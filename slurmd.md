## NAME

slurmd - The compute node daemon for Slurm.

## SYNOPSIS

**slurmd** [*OPTIONS*...]

## DESCRIPTION

**slurmd** is the compute node daemon of Slurm. It monitors all tasks
running on the compute node , accepts work (tasks), launches tasks, and kills
running tasks upon request.

## OPTIONS

**--authinfo**
:   Used with configless to set an alternate AuthInfo parameter to be used to
    establish communication with slurmctld before the configuration file has been
    retrieved. (E.g., to specify an alternate MUNGE socket location.)

    : **-b** : Report node rebooted when daemon restarted. Used for testing purposes. : **-c** : Clear system locks as needed. This may be required if **slurmd** terminated abnormally. : **-C** : Print the actual hardware configuration (not the configuration from the slurm.conf file) and exit. The format of output is the same as used in **slurm.conf** to describe a node's configuration plus its uptime. You may use **--parameters** to specify options such as 'l3cache\_as\_socket' which may alter the reported node topology. : **--ca-cert-file <file>** : Absolute path to CA certificate used for fetching configuration when running configless in a TLS enabled cluster. : **--conf <node parameters>** : Used in conjunction with the **-Z** option. Used to override or define additional parameters of a dynamic node using the same syntax and parameters used to define nodes in the slurm.conf. Specifying any of **CPUs**, **Boards**, **SocketsPerBoard**, **CoresPerSocket** or **ThreadsPerCore** will override the defaults defined by the **-C** option. **NodeName** and **Port** are not supported. This can also be used to specify a cloud node's topology, in which case the **-Z** flag should not be used (e.g., --conf="topology=topo-switch:s1") For example if *slurmd -C* reports ``` NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=31848 ``` the following --conf specifications will generate the corresponding node definitions: ``` --conf "Gres=gpu:2" NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=31848 Gres=gpu:2 ``` ``` --conf "RealMemory=30000" NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=30000 ``` ``` --conf "CPUs=16" NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 RealMemory=331848 ``` ``` --conf "CPUs=16 RealMemory=30000 Gres=gpu:2" NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 RealMemory=30000 Gres=gpu:2" ``` : **--conf-server <host|ip address>[:<port>]** : Comma-separated list of controllers, the first being the primary slurmctld. A port can (optionally) be specified for each controller. These hosts are where the slurmd will fetch the configuration from when running in "configless" mode. **NOTE**: If specifying an IPv6 address, wrap the <ip address> in [] to distinguish the address from the port. This is required even if no port is specified. : **-d <file>** : Specify the fully qualified pathname to the **slurmstepd** program to be used for shepherding user job steps. This can be useful for testing purposes. : **-D** : Run **slurmd** in the foreground with logging copied to stderr. : **--extra <arbitrary string>** : Set "extra" data on node startup. If this is a json string and **SchedulerParameters=extra\_constraints** is set in slurm.conf, then jobs may use the --extra option to filter based on this "extra" data. : **-f <file>** : Read configuration from the specified file. See **NOTES** below. : **-F[feature]** : Start this node as a Dynamic Future node. It will try to match a node definition with a state of **FUTURE**, optionally using the specified feature to match the node definition. : **-G** : Print Generic RESource (GRES) configuration (based upon slurm.conf GRES merged with gres.conf contents for this node) and exit. : **-h** : Help; print a brief summary of command options. : **--instance-id <cloud instance id>** : Set cloud instance ID on node startup. : **--instance-type <cloud instance type>** : Set cloud instance type on node startup. : **-L <file>** : Write log messages to the specified file. : **-M** : Lock slurmd pages into system memory using mlockall (2) to disable paging of the slurmd process. This may help in cases where nodes are marked DOWN during periods of heavy swap activity. If the mlockall (2) system call is not available, an error will be printed to the log and slurmd will continue as normal. It is suggested to set **LaunchParameters=slurmstepd\_memlock** in **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.html)**(5) when setting **-M**. : **-n <value>** : Set the daemon's nice value to the specified value, typically a negative number. Also note the **PropagatePrioProcess** configuration parameter. : **-N <nodename>** : Run the daemon with the given nodename. Used to emulate a larger system with more than one slurmd daemon per node. Requires that Slurm be built using the --enable-multiple-slurmd configure option. : **--parameters <slurmd parameters>** : Allows for temporary node-specific changes to SlurmdParameters. Can be used alongside **-C** to specify options such as 'l3cache\_as\_socket' which may alter the reported node topology. These parameters are appended to any node-specific Parameters defined in slurm.conf. : **-s** : Change working directory of slurmd to SlurmdLogFile path if possible, or to SlurmdSpoolDir otherwise. If both of them fail it will fallback to /var/tmp. : **--systemd** : Use when starting the daemon with systemd. This will allow slurmd to notify systemd of the new PID when using 'scontrol reconfigure'. : **-v** : Verbose operation. Multiple -v's increase verbosity. : **-V**, **--version** : Print version information and exit. : **-Z** : Start this node as a Dynamic Normal node. If no **--conf** is specified, then the slurmd will register with the same hardware configuration (except GRES) as defined by the **-C** option.

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables can be used to override settings
compiled into slurmd.

**ABORT\_ON\_FATAL**
:   When a fatal error is detected, use abort() instead of exit() to terminate the
    process. This allows backtraces to be captured without recompiling Slurm.

    : **SLURM\_CONF** : The location of the Slurm configuration file. This is overridden by explicitly naming a configuration file on the command line. : **SLURM\_DEBUG\_FLAGS** : Specify debug flags for slurmd to use. See DebugFlags in the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.html)**(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

## HTTP server

Unless disabled via *CommunicationParameters=disable\_http* in
**slurm.conf**, **slurmd** will accept incoming HTTP/1.1 compliant
requests to any socket listening as configured by **SlurmdPort** in
**slurm.conf**. Authentication of HTTP requests is not supported. TLS
wrapping optionally supported without requiring **TLSType** in
**slurm.conf**. The following endpoints are currently supported:

**GET /**
:   Get list of endpoints.

    : **GET /healthz** : Test if **slurmd** loaded successfully. : **GET /livez** : Test if **slurmd** loaded successfully. : **GET /readyz** : Test if **slurmd** is ready to accept incoming RPCs.

## SIGNALS

**SIGTERM SIGINT SIGQUIT**
:   **slurmd** will shutdown cleanly.

    : **SIGHUP** : Reloads the slurm configuration files, similar to 'scontrol reconfigure'. : **SIGUSR2** : Reread the log level from the configs, and then reopen the log file. This should be used when setting up **logrotate**(8). : **SIGPIPE** : This signal is explicitly ignored.

## CORE FILE LOCATION

If slurmd is started with the **-D** option then the core file will be
written to the current working directory.
Otherwise if **SlurmdLogFile** is a fully qualified path name
(starting with a slash), the core file will be written to the same
directory as the log file. Otherwise the core file will be written to
the **SlurmdSpoolDir** directory, or "/var/tmp/" as a last resort. If
none of the above directories can be written, no core file will be
produced.

## NOTES

It may be useful to experiment with different **slurmd** specific
configuration parameters using a distinct configuration file
(e.g. timeouts). However, this special configuration file will not be
used by the **slurmctld** daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you
specifically tell each of them to use it. If you desire changing
communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or
other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common
configuration file, **slurm.conf**.

If you are using configless mode with a login node that runs a lot of client
commands, you may consider running **slurmd** on that machine so it can
manage a cached version of the configuration files. Otherwise, each client
command will use the DNS record to contact the controller and get the
configuration information, which could place additional load on the controller.
