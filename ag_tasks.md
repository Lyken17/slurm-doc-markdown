read through all the slurm doc on https://slurm.schedmd.com and parse into structured markdown locally

Note
1. click the links and scrap information for all slurm related pages under the same domain
2. save the converted markdown file into `docs/`
3. note there are some hyperlink points to "*.html" under the same domain, this should be converted to "*.md" so it can be properlly parsed in markdown.
