# Slurm Documentation Archive

This directory contains a local copy of the [Slurm Workload Manager documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), scraped and converted to Markdown for MCP / Skills related LLM usage. The copyright still belongs to the original slurm team.

**Generated on:** 2026-01-20

## Contents

The files are named after their source URLs (e.g., `quickstart.html` -> `docs/quickstart.md`).
The content has been stripped of navigation bars, footers, and scripts to focus on the documentation text.

## Usage

You can use any Markdown viewer to read these files.
Links between pages are preserved as relative links (pointing to `.html` in the original source, which most markdown viewers might not follow to the `.md` file without adjustment, but the text is preserved).

*Note: This is an automated scrape. Some complex formatting or dynamic content may not be perfectly preserved.*
