# User Permissions

Slurm supports several special user permissions as described below.

## Operator

These users can add, modify, and remove any database object
(user, account, etc), and add other operators.
On a SlurmDBD served cluster, these users can

* View information that is blocked to regular uses by a PrivateData flag
* Create/Alter/Delete Reservations

Set using an **AdminLevel** option in the user's database record.
For configuration information, see
[Accounting and Resource Limits](accounting.html).

## Admin

These users have the same level of privileges as an operator in the database.
They can also alter anything on a served slurmctld as if they were the SlurmUser
or root.

An **AdminLevel** option in the user's database record.
For configuration information, see
[Accounting and Resource Limits](accounting.html).

## Coordinator

A special privileged user, usually an account manager, that can add
users or sub-accounts to the account they are coordinator over.
This should be a trusted person since they can change limits on account and
user associations, as well as cancel, requeue or reassign accounts of jobs
inside their realm. Note that a coordinator may not increase job limits above
the parent ones.

Set using a table in Slurm's database defining users and accounts for
which they can serve as coordinators.
For configuration information, see the
[sacctmgr](sacctmgr.html) man page.
