# Related Software

Slurm source can be downloaded from
<https://www.schedmd.com/download-slurm/>.

Note that the following related software is not written or maintained by
SchedMD. Some of the software is required for certain functionality
(e.g. MySQL or MariaDB are required to use slurmdbd) while other software
was written to provide additional functionality for users or
administrators.

* **Authentication** plugins identifies the user originating
  a message.

+ **MUNGE** (recommended)  
  In order to compile the "auth/munge" authentication plugin for Slurm,
  you will need to build and install MUNGE, available from
  <https://dun.github.io/munge/> and
  [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/src:munge) and
  [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) and
  [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/src:munge).

* **Authentication** tools for users that work with Slurm.

+ [AUKS](https://github.com/hautreux/auks)  
  AUKS is an utility designed to ease Kerberos V credential support addition
  to non-interactive applications, like batch systems (Slurm, LSF, Torque, etc.).
  It includes a plugin for the Slurm workload manager. AUKS is not used as
  an authentication plugin by the Slurm code itself, but provides a mechanism
  for the application to manage Kerberos V credentials.

* **Databases** can be used to store accounting information.
  See our [Accounting](accounting.md) web page for more information.

+ [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
+ [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

  
* **DRMAA (Distributed Resource Management Application API)**  
  [PSNC DRMAA](https://github.com/psnc-apps/slurm-drmaa) for Slurm
  is an implementation of [Open Grid Forum](http://www.gridforum.org/)
  [DRMAA 1.0](http://www.drmaa.org/) (Distributed Resource Management Application API)
  [specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.133.pdf) for submission
  and control of jobs to [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com).
  Using DRMAA, grid applications builders, portal developers and ISVs can use
  the same high-level API to link their software with different cluster/resource
  management systems.  
    
  There is a variant of PSNC DRMAA providing support for Slurm's --cluster option
  available from
  <https://github.com/natefoo/slurm-drmaa>.  
    
  Perl 6 DRMAA bindings are available from
  <https://github.com/scovit/Scheduler-DRMAA>.
  
* **Hardware topology**

+ [Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc)](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)
+ **NOTE**: If you build Slurm or any MPI stack component with hwloc, note
  that versions 2.5.0 through 2.7.0 (inclusive) of hwloc have a bug that pushes an
  untouchable value into the environ array, causing a segfault when accessing it.
  It is advisable to build with hwloc version 2.7.1 or later.
+ Used by slurmd and PMIx client to get hardware topology information.

* **Hostlist**  
  A Python program used for manipulation of Slurm hostlists including
  functions such as intersection and difference. Download the code from:  
  <http://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist>  
    
  Lua bindings for hostlist functions are also available here:  
  <https://github.com/grondo/lua-hostlist>  
  **NOTE**: The Lua hostlist functions do not support the bracketed numeric
  ranges anywhere except at the end of the name (i.e. "tux[0001-0100]"
  and "rack[0-3]\_blade[0-63]" are not supported).
  
* **MPI** versions supported

+ [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library)
+ [MPICH (a.k.a. MPICH2 / MPICH2)](https://www.mpich.org/)
+ [MVAPICH (a.k.a MVAPICH2)](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/)
+ [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org)

* **Command wrappers**  
  There is a wrapper for Maui/Moab's showq command
  [here](https://github.com/pedmon/slurm_showq).
  
* **Scripting interfaces**

+ A **Perl** interface is included in the Slurm distribution in the
  *contribs/perlapi* directory and packaged in the *perlapi* RPM.
+ [PySlurm](https://github.com/pyslurm/) is a
  Python/Cython module to interface with Slurm.
  There is also a Python module to expand and collect hostlist expressions
  available [here](http://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist/).

  
* **SPANK Plugins**  
  SPANK provides a very generic interface for stackable plug-ins which
  may be used to dynamically modify the job launch code in Slurm. SPANK
  plugins may be built without access to Slurm source code. They need
  only be compiled against Slurm‘s spank.h header file, added to the
  SPANK config file plugstack.conf, and they will be loaded at runtime
  during the next job launch. Thus, the SPANK infrastructure provides
  administrators and other developers a low cost, low effort ability to
  dynamically modify the runtime behavior of Slurm job launch.
  Additional documentation can be found
  [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/spank.md).
  
* **Node Health Check**  
  Probably the most comprehensive and lightweight health check tool out
  there is
  [LBNL Node Health Check](https://github.com/mej/nhc).
  It has integration with Slurm as well as Torque resource managers.
  
* **Accounting Tools**
  + **UBMoD** is a web based tool for displaying accounting data from various
    resource managers. It aggregates the accounting data from sacct into a MySQL
    data warehouse and provide a front end web interface for browsing the data.
    For more information, see the
    [UDMod home page](http://ubmod.sourceforge.net/resource-manager-slurm.html) and
    [source code](https://github.com/ubccr/ubmod).
  + [**XDMoD**](http://xdmod.sourceforge.net) (XD Metrics on Demand)
    is an NSF-funded open source tool designed to audit and facilitate the utilization
    of the XSEDE cyberinfrastructure by providing a wide range of metrics on XSEDE
    resources, including resource utilization, resource performance, and impact on
    scholarship and research.
  
* **STUBL (Slurm Tools and UBiLities)**  
  STUBL is a collection of supplemental tools and utility scripts for Slurm.  
  [STUBL home page](https://github.com/ubccr/stubl).
  
* **pestat**  
  Prints a consolidated compute node status line, with one line per node
  including a list of jobs.  
  [Home page](https://github.com/OleHolmNielsen/Slurm_tools/tree/master/pestat)
  
* **Graphical Sdiag**  
  The sdiag utility is a diagnostic tool that maintains statistics on Slurm's
  scheduling performance. You can run sdiag periodically or as you modify
  Slurm's configuration. However if you want a historical view of these
  statistics, you could save them in a time-series database and graph them over
  time as performed with this tool:
  + [A collection of custom diamond collectors to gather various Slurm statistics](https://github.com/fasrc/slurm-diamond-collector)
  + [Collectd](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/1198)
    (for use with [jobmetrics](https://github.com/edf-hpc/jobmetrics))
  
* [**JSON**](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki)

  Some Slurm plugins ([slurmrestd](rest.md),
  [burst\_buffer/datawarp](burst_buffer.md),
  [burst\_buffer/lua](burst_buffer.md),
  [jobcomp/elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md), and
  [jobcomp/kafka](jobcomp_kafka.md)) parse and/or
  serialize JSON format data. These plugins and slurmrestd are designed to
  make use of the **JSON-C library (>= v0.15)** for this purpose.

  mkdir json-c-build
  cd json-c-build
  cmake ../json-c
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

  Declare the package configuration path before compiling Slurm
  (example provided for /bin/sh):

  ```
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  ```

  ```
  
* [**YAML Parser**](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml)

  [slurmrestd](rest.md) and commands that recognize a
  `--yaml` flag will be able to parse YAML if **libyaml
  (>= v0.2.5)** is present. Instructions for the build are as follows:

  ```
  git clone --depth 1 --single-branch -b 0.2.5 https://github.com/yaml/libyaml libyaml

  ```
  
* [**JWT library**](https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt)

  [JWT authentication](jwt.md) requires **libjwt
