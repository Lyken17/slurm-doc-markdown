# Trackable RESources (TRES)

A TRES is a resource that can be tracked for usage or used to enforce
limits against. A TRES is a combination of a Type and a Name.
Types are predefined.
Current TRES Types are:

* BB (burst buffers)
* Billing
* CPU
* Energy
* FS (filesystem)
* GRES
* IC (interconnect)
* License
* Mem (Memory)
* Node
* Pages
* VMem (Virtual Memory/Size)

The Billing TRES is calculated from a partition's TRESBillingWeights. See
below for details.

Valid 'FS' TRES are 'disk' (local disk) and 'lustre'. These are primarily
there for reporting usage, not limiting access.

Valid 'IC' TRES is 'ofed'. These are primarily there for reporting usage, not
limiting access.

## slurm.conf settings

### TRES Tracking

**AccountingStorageTRES**
  
Used to define which TRES are
to be tracked on the system. By default Billing, CPU, Energy, Memory, Node,
FS/Disk, Pages and VMem are tracked. These default TRES cannot be disabled,
but only appended to. The following example:

```
AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,license/iop1
```

will track billing, cpu, energy, memory, nodes, fs/disk, pages and vmem along
with a GRES called gpu, as well as a license called iop1. Whenever these
resources are used on the cluster they are recorded. TRES are automatically
set up in the database on the start of the slurmctld.

The TRES that require associated names are BB, GRES, and
License. As seen in the above example, GRES and License are typically
different on each system. The BB TRES is named the same as
the burst buffer plugin being used. In the above example we are using the
*Cray* burst buffer plugin.

When including a specific GRES with a subtype, it is also recommended to
include its generic type, otherwise a request with only the generic one won't
be accounted for. For example, if we want to account for gres/gpu:tesla,
we would also include gres/gpu for accounting gpus in requests like
*srun --gres=gpu:1*.

```
AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla
```

**NOTE**: Setting gres/gpu will also set gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil.
gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil can be set individually when gres/gpu is not set.

### Priority Weights

**PriorityWeightTRES**
  
A comma separated list of TRES Types and weights that sets the
degree that each TRES Type contributes to the job's priority.

```
PriorityWeightTRES=CPU=1000,Mem=2000,GRES/gpu=3000
```

Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor and if
AccountingStorageTRES is configured with each TRES Type.
The default values are 0.

The Billing TRES is not available for priority calculations because the
number isn't generated until after the job has been allocated resources —
since the number can change for different partitions.

### Billing Weights

**TRESBillingWeights**
  
Comma-separated list of `<TRES Type>=<Numeric Weight>`
pairs defining the billing weights of one or more tracked TRES types that will
be used in calculating the usage of a job in each partition. The resulting usage
amount is used when calculating [fairshare](priority_multifactor.md#fairshare) and when enforcing any [resource
limits](resource_limits.md) that are configured for the **billing** TRES. See also
[PriorityWeightTRES](slurm.conf.md#OPT_PriorityWeightTRES) to
adjust job priority directly based on TRES usage.

Any TRES type tracked by
[AccountingStorageTRES](slurm.conf.md#OPT_AccountingStorageTRES)
is available for billing, except the **billing** TRES which is ignored since
it is the result of this weighted calculation.

By default, jobs are billed against the total number of allocated CPUs
i.e., `TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1"`.

The weighted amount of a resource can be adjusted by adding a suffix of
`[KMGTP]` after the billing weight. The base unit for memory and burst
buffers is Megabytes. For example, a memory weight of `mem=0.25` on a
job allocated 8GB will result in 2048 billed units (8192MB \* 0.25). A memory
weight of `mem=0.25G` on the same job will result in 2 billed units
((8192MB/1024) \* 0.25).

By default the billing of TRES is calculated as the sum of all TRES types
multiplied by their corresponding billing weight. For example, consider a
partition with these billing weights configured:

```
TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1.0,Mem=0.25G,GRES/gpu=2.0,license/licA=1.5"
```

A job in this partition that gets allocated 1 CPU and 8 GB of memory would be
billed as:

```
(1*1.0) + (8*0.25) + (0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 3.0
```

Note that TRES weights may be floating-point/decimal values, and that this
precision will be retained during the billing calculation. However, the final
billing amount is stored as an integer and truncated if needed. For example,
consider how adding a license or adding additional memory and a license to the
above example job would affect the billed amount:

```
(1*1.0) + (8*0.25) + (0*2.0) + (1*1.5) = 4.5 => 4
(1*1.0) + (10*0.25) + (0*2.0) + (1*1.5) = 5.0 => 5
```

### Priority Flags

Two of the available **PriorityFlags** relate to the interpretation of the
**TRESBillingWeights** field.

**PriorityFlags=MAX\_TRES**
  
If this flag is set, the billable TRES is calculated as the sum of the
following:

* MAX of individual TRESs (those tied to a specific node, e.g., cpus, mem, gres)
* SUM of all global TRESs (those available on any nodes, e.g., licenses)

Using the same example above, the billable TRES will be:

```
MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25, 0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 2.0
```

**PriorityFlags=MAX\_TRES\_GRES**
  
If this flag is set, the billable TRES is calculated as the sum of the
following:

* SUM of all billable GRESs (e.g., GPUs)
* MAX of other individual TRESs (those tied to a specific node, e.g., cpus, mem)
* SUM of all global TRESs (those available on any nodes, e.g., licenses)

With this flag set, the billable TRES will be:

```
(0*2.0) + MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25) + (0*1.5) = 2.0
```

Adding a GPU to the example job, the billable TRES will be:

```
(1*2.0) + MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25) + (0*1.5) = 3.0
```

## sacct

sacct can be used to view the TRES of each job by adding "tres" to the
--format option.

## sacctmgr

sacctmgr is used to view the various TRES available globally in the
system. *sacctmgr show tres* will do this.

## sreport

sreport reports on different TRES. Simply using the comma separated input
option *--tres=* will have sreport generate reports available
for the requested TRES types. More information about these reports
can be found on the [sreport manpage](sreport.md).

In *sreport*, the "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest
Billing TRES of each node multiplied by the time frame. For example, if a node
is part of multiple partitions and each has a different TRESBillingWeights
defined the Billing TRES for the node will be the highest of the partitions.
If TRESBillingWeights is not defined on any partition for a node then the
Billing TRES will be equal to the number of CPUs on the node.
