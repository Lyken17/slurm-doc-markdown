# Prolog and Epilog Guide

Slurm supports a multitude of prolog and epilog programs.
Note that for security reasons, these programs do not have a search path set.
Either specify fully qualified path names in the program or set the
PATH
environment variable.
The first table below identifies what prologs and epilogs are available for job
allocations, when and where they run.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Parameter** | **Location** | **Invoked by** | **User** | **When executed** |
| Prolog (from slurm.conf) | Compute node | slurmd daemon | SlurmdUser (normally user root) | First job or job step initiation on that node (by default); PrologFlags=Alloc will force the script to be executed at job allocation |
| PrologSlurmctld (from slurm.conf) | Head node (where slurmctld daemon runs) | slurmctld daemon | SlurmctldUser | At job allocation |
| Epilog (from slurm.conf) | Compute node | slurmd daemon | SlurmdUser (normally user root) | At job termination |
| EpilogSlurmctld (from slurm.conf) | Head node (where slurmctld daemon runs) | slurmctld daemon | SlurmctldUser | At job termination |

  

This second table below identifies what prologs and epilogs are available for job
step allocations, when and where they run.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Parameter** | **Location** | **Invoked by** | **User** | **When executed** |
| SrunProlog (from slurm.conf) or srun --prolog | srun invocation node | srun command | User invoking srun command | Prior to launching job step |
| TaskProlog (from slurm.conf) | Compute node | slurmstepd daemon | User invoking srun command | Prior to launching job step |
| srun --task-prolog | Compute node | slurmstepd daemon | User invoking srun command | Prior to launching job step |
| TaskEpilog (from slurm.conf) | Compute node | slurmstepd daemon | User invoking srun command | Completion job step |
| srun --task-epilog | Compute node | slurmstepd daemon | User invoking srun command | Completion job step |
| SrunEpilog (from slurm.conf) or srun --epilog | srun invocation node | srun command | User invoking srun command | Completion job step |

By default the Prolog script is only run on any individual
node when it first sees a job step from a new allocation; it does not
run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted. If no job steps
from an allocation are run on a node, it will never run the Prolog for that
allocation. This Prolog behavior can be changed by the
PrologFlags parameter. The Epilog, on the other hand, always
runs on every node of an allocation when the allocation is released.

If multiple prolog and/or epilog scripts are specified,
(e.g. "/etc/slurm/prolog.d/\*") they will run in reverse alphabetical order
(z-a -> Z-A -> 9-0).

Prolog and Epilog scripts should be designed to be as short as possible
and should not call Slurm commands (e.g. squeue, scontrol, sacctmgr, etc).
Long running scripts can cause scheduling problems when jobs take a long time
to start or finish. Slurm commands in these scripts can potentially lead to
performance issues and should not be used.

The task prolog is executed with the same environment as the user tasks to
be initiated. The standard output of that program is read and processed as
follows:  
export name=value
sets an environment variable for the user task  
unset name
clears an environment variable from the user task  
print ...
writes to the task's standard output.

A TaskProlog script can just be a bash script. Here is a very basic example:

```
#!/bin/bash

# The TaskProlog script can be used for any preliminary work needed
# before running a job step, and it can also be used to modify the
# user's environment. There are two main mechanisms for that, which
# rely on printing commands to stdout:

# Make a variable available for the user
echo "export VARIABLE_1=HelloWorld"

# Unset variables for the user
echo "unset MANPATH"

# We can also print messages if needed
echo "print This message has been printed with TaskProlog"
```

The above functionality is limited to the task prolog script.

## Failure Handling

If the Epilog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state.
If the EpilogSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will only
be logged.
If the Prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state and the job requeued. The job will be placed
in a held state unless nohold\_on\_prolog\_fail is configured in
SchedulerParameters.
If the PrologSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will cause
the job to be requeued. Only batch jobs can be requeued. Interactive jobs
(salloc and srun) will be cancelled if the PrologSlurmctld fails.

If a task epilog or srun epilog fails (returns a non-zero exit code) this
will only be logged.
If a task prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), the task will be
canceled.
If the srun prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), the step will be
canceled.

## Environment Variables

Unless otherwise specified, these environment variables are available
to all of the programs.

* **CUDA\_MPS\_ACTIVE\_THREAD\_PERCENTAGE**
  Specifies the percentage of a GPU that should be allocated to the job.
  The value is set only if the gres/mps plugin is configured and the job
  requests those resources.
  Available in Prolog and Epilog only.
* **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES**
  Specifies the GPU devices for the job allocation.
  The value is set only if the gres/gpu or gres/mps plugin is configured and the
  job requests those resources.
  Note that the environment variable set for the job may differ from that set for
  the Prolog and Epilog if Slurm is configured to constrain the device files
  visible to a job using Linux cgroup.
  This is because the Prolog and Epilog programs run outside of any Linux
  cgroup while the job runs inside of the cgroup and may thus have a
  different set of visible devices.
  For example, if a job is allocated the device "/dev/nvidia1", then
  the Prolog and Epilog will have **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=1** set, while the
  job will have **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0** set (i.e. the first GPU device
  visible to the job).
  **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES** will be set unless otherwise excluded via the
  *Flags* or *AutoDetect* options in *gres.conf*. See also
  **SLURM\_JOB\_GPUS**. Available in Prolog and Epilog only.
* **GPU\_DEVICE\_ORDINAL**
  Specifies the GPU devices for the job allocation. The considerations for
  **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES** also apply to **GPU\_DEVICE\_ORDINAL**.
* **ROCR\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES**
  Specifies the GPU devices for the job allocation. The considerations for
  **CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES** also apply to **ROCR\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES**.

Plugin functions may also be useful to execute logic at various well-defined
points.

[SPANK](spank.md) is another mechanism that may be useful
to invoke logic in the user commands, slurmd daemon, and slurmstepd daemon.
