# Mailing Lists

SchedMD maintains two Slurm mailing lists:

* **slurm-announce@schedmd.com** is designated for communications about
  Slurm releases. Only SchedMD may post to this list. Low traffic.
* **slurm-users@schedmd.com** (formerly slurm-dev@schedmd.com) is for
  discussion by the Slurm community, and is typically used by Slurm system
  administrators for discussion and community-provided support. (Please see the
  [SchedMD support page](https://www.schedmd.com/support.php)
  page for commercial support options.)
  Any person subscribed to this mailing list may post to it. High traffic.

You can subscribe to either list, change your subscription options, or
unsubscribe through the
[Mailman interface here](https://lists.schedmd.com/mailman3/postorius/lists/).

An archive of the **slurm-users** list is online:
