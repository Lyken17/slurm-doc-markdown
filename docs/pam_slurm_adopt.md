# pam\_slurm\_adopt

The purpose of this module is to prevent users from sshing into nodes that
they do not have a running job on, and to track the ssh connection and any
other spawned processes for accounting and to ensure complete job cleanup when
the job is completed. This module does this by determining the job which
originated the ssh connection. The user's connection is "adopted" into the
"external" step of the job. When access is denied, the user will receive a
relevant error message.

## Installation

### Source:

In your Slurm source directory, navigate to ./contribs/pam\_slurm\_adopt/
and run the following as **root**:

```
make && make install
```

This will place pam\_slurm\_adopt.a, pam\_slurm\_adopt.la,
and pam\_slurm\_adopt.so in /lib/security/ (on Debian systems) or
/lib64/security/ (on RedHat/SUSE systems). This install location
is not affected by configure's --prefix flag; use --with-pam\_dir=PATH
to modify the install location if desired.

### RPM:

The included slurm.spec will build a slurm-pam\_slurm RPM which will install
pam\_slurm\_adopt. Refer to the
[Quick Start
Administrator Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html) for instructions on managing an RPM-based install.

### DEB:

The included debian packaging scripts will build the
slurm-smd-libpam-slurm-adopt package which will install pam\_slurm\_adopt.

## Slurm Configuration

**PrologFlags=contain** must be set in the slurm.conf. This sets up the
"extern" step into which ssh-launched processes will be adopted. You must also
enable the task/cgroup plugin in slurm.conf. See the
[Slurm cgroups guide.](https://slurm.schedmd.com/cgroups.html)
**CAUTION** This option must be in place *before* using this module.
The module bases its checks on local steps that have already been launched. Jobs
launched without this option do not have an extern step, so pam\_slurm\_adopt will
not have access to those jobs.

**LaunchParameters=ulimit\_pam\_adopt** will set RLIMIT\_RSS in processes
adopted by the external step, similar to tasks running in regular steps.

The **UsePAM** option in slurm.conf is not related to pam\_slurm\_adopt.

## SSH Configuration

Verify that **UsePAM** is set to **On** in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config (it
should be on by default).

Ensure that only supported **AuthenticationMethods** are enabled in
sshd\_config (on the compute nodes). At this time, only **publickey** and
**password** are supported. In particular **keyboard-interactive** is
explicitly unsupported and must be removed from **AuthenticationMethods**.
If this step is not observed process adoption will be broken
and SSH sessions will persist even after the job ends. See
 [Limitations](#LIMITATIONS) for more information.

## PAM Configuration

For initial testing (see **warning** below), add the following line to the
appropriate file in /etc/pam.d, such as system-auth or sshd (you may use either
the "required" or "sufficient" PAM control flag):

```
account    required      pam_slurm_adopt.so
```

The order of plugins is very important. pam\_slurm\_adopt.so should be the
last PAM module in the account stack. Included files such as common-account
should normally be included before pam\_slurm\_adopt.
You might have the following account stack in sshd:

```
account    required      pam_nologin.so
account    include       password-auth
...
-account    required      pam_slurm_adopt.so
```

Note the "-" before the account entry for pam\_slurm\_adopt. It allows
PAM to fail gracefully if the pam\_slurm\_adopt.so file is not found. If Slurm
is on a shared filesystem, such as NFS, then this is suggested to avoid being
locked out of a node while the shared filesystem is mounting or down.

pam\_slurm\_adopt must be used with the task/cgroup task plugin and the
proctrack/cgroup proctrack plugin.
The pam\_systemd module will conflict with pam\_slurm\_adopt, so you need to
disable it in all files that are included in sshd or system-auth (e.g.
password-auth, common-session, etc.).

**WARNING**: The default configuration for pam\_slurm\_adopt is meant to
ensure an admin is not locked out of a node during testing. Production
environments should consider setting both
[action\_adopt\_failure](#action_adopt_failure) and
[action\_generic\_failure](#action_generic_failure) to **deny**
after successful testing; otherwise, plugin failures may allow users to log in
unconfined. Future examples on this page will include these flags.

If you need the user management features from pam\_systemd, such as
handling user runtime directory /run/user/$UID, you can have the prolog script
run 'loginctl enable-linger $SLURM\_JOB\_USER' and the epilog script disable
it again (after making sure there are no other jobs from this user on the node)
by running 'loginctl disable-linger $SLURM\_JOB\_USER'. You will also need to
export the XDG\_\* environment variables if your software requires them.
You can see an example of prolog and epilog scripts here:

Prolog:

```
loginctl enable-linger $SLURM_JOB_USER
exit 0
```

TaskProlog:

```
echo "export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$SLURM_JOB_UID"
echo "export XDG_SESSION_ID=$(</proc/self/sessionid)"
echo "export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty"
echo "export XDG_SESSION_CLASS=user"
```

Epilog:

```
#Only disable linger if this is the last job running for this user.
O_P=0
for pid in $(scontrol listpids | awk -v jid=$SLURM_JOB_ID 'NR!=1 { if ($2 != jid && $1 != "-1"){print $1} }'); do
        ps --noheader -o euser p $pid | grep -q $SLURM_JOB_USER && O_P=1
done
if [ $O_P -eq 0 ]; then
        loginctl disable-linger $SLURM_JOB_USER
fi
exit 0
```

You must also make sure a different PAM
module isn't short-circuiting the account stack before it gets to
pam\_slurm\_adopt.so. From the example above, the following two lines have been
commented out in the included password-auth file:

```
#account    sufficient    pam_localuser.so
#-session   optional      pam_systemd.so
```

Note: This may involve editing a file that is auto-generated.
Do not run the config script that generates the file or your
changes will be erased.

## Administrative Access Configuration

pam\_slurm\_adopt will always allow the root user access, and will do so even
before checking for slurm configuration. If you wish to also allow other admins
to the system with their own user accounts, this can be accomplished by stacking
other modules along with pam\_slurm\_adopt.

Stacking pam\_access with pam\_slurm\_adopt is one way to permit administrative
access, with two possible implementations with subtle differences in behavior.
Both will require editing the pam\_access configuration file
(/etc/security/access.conf). In the following example, the access.conf file will
allow members of the group "wheel" to log in.

```
+:(wheel):ALL
-:ALL:ALL
```

Then you will need to stack the modules in the /etc/pam.d/sshd file. The order
here matters, and each ordering has different implications. In the example
below, pam\_slurm adopt is listed first as "sufficient", followed by pam\_access.
In this configuration when the admin has a job running, their ssh session
will be adopted into the job. If they do not, access will be permitted by
pam\_access, but note that pam\_slurm\_adopt will still emit the "access denied"
message.

```
account    sufficient    pam_slurm_adopt.so action_adopt_failure=deny action_generic_failure=deny
account    required      pam_access.so
```

Flipping this order, with pam\_access(sufficient) before
pam\_slurm\_adopt(required), members of the administrative group will bypass
pam\_slurm\_adopt entirely.

```
account    sufficient    pam_access.so
account    required      pam_slurm_adopt.so action_adopt_failure=deny action_generic_failure=deny
```

The pam\_listfile module is another module that can be stacked with
pam\_slurm\_adopt and achieve similar results. In the following example, it will
allow all users in the specified file to log in, skipping the pam\_slurm\_adopt
module. This can also be flipped similar to pam\_access, with the same
implications.

```
account    sufficient    pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow onerr=fail file=/path/to/allowed_users_file
account    required      pam_slurm_adopt.so action_adopt_failure=deny action_generic_failure=deny
```

The pam\_listfile module can also be configured to look for membership of a
group. In this example, instead of checking the user, the plugin checks that
the user belongs to one of the groups specified in the 'groupfile'.
If pam\_systemd is needed for those users, you can link it to the
pam\_listfile.so module in the session phase, as shown below.
If the pam\_listfile module succeeds, the evaluation continues (success=ignore).
Otherwise, the next module (pam\_systemd) is ignored (default=1 skips the next
module). The pam\_systemd module will only be used for admin users in this
example.

```
account    sufficient                    pam_listfile.so item=group sense=allow onerr=fail file=/path/to/allowed_users_file
-account   required                      pam_slurm_adopt.so action_adopt_failure=deny action_generic_failure=deny

session    [default=1 success=ignore]    pam_listfile.so item=group sense=allow onerr=fail file=/etc/groupfile
-session   optional                      pam_systemd.so
```

More information about the capabilities and configuration options for pam\_access
and pam\_listfile can be found in their respective man pages.

## pam\_slurm\_adopt Module Options

This module is configurable. Add these options to the end of the pam\_slurm\_adopt
line in the appropriate file in /etc/pam.d/ (e.g., sshd or system-auth):

```
account sufficient pam_slurm_adopt.so optionname=optionvalue
```

This module has the following options:

**action\_no\_jobs**
:   The action to perform if the user has no jobs on the node. Configurable
    values are:

    :   **ignore**
        :   Do nothing. Fall through to the next pam module.

        **deny** (default)
        :   Deny the connection.

**action\_unknown**
:   The action to perform when the user has multiple jobs on the node **and**
    the RPC does not locate the source job. If the RPC mechanism works properly in
    your environment, this option will likely be relevant **only** when
    connecting from a login node. Configurable values are:

    :   **newest** (default)
        :   On systems with *cgroup/v1* pick the newest job on the node.
            The "newest" job is chosen based on the mtime of the job's step\_extern cgroup;
            asking Slurm would require an RPC to the controller. Thus, the memory cgroup
            must be in use so that the code can check mtimes of cgroup directories. The user
            can ssh in but may be adopted into a job that exits earlier than the
            job they intended to check on. The ssh connection will at least be
            subject to appropriate limits and the user can be informed of better
            ways to accomplish their objectives if this becomes a problem.
            **NOTE**: If the module fails to retrieve the cgroup mtime, then the picked
            job may not be the newest one.
            On systems with *cgroup/v2* the newest is just the job with the greatest
            id, and thus this does not ensure that it is really the newest job.

        **allow**
        :   Let the connection through without adoption.

        **deny**
        :   Deny the connection.

**action\_adopt\_failure**
:   The action to perform if the process is unable to be adopted into any
    job for whatever reason. If the process cannot be adopted into the job
    identified by the callerid RPC, it will fall through to the action\_unknown
    code and try to adopt there. A failure at that point or if there is only
    one job will result in this action being taken. Configurable values are:

    :   **allow** (default)
        :   Let the connection through without adoption.
              
            **WARNING**: This value allows connections that were not able to be
            adopted into a job, which could allow users complete access to a node, not just
            to their allocated resources. This value is recommended for testing purposes
            only, we recommend using "deny" in production systems.

        **deny**
        :   Deny the connection.

**action\_generic\_failure**
:   The action to perform if there are certain failures such as the
    inability to talk to the local *slurmd* or if the kernel doesn't offer
    the correct facilities. Configurable values are:

    :   **ignore** (default)
        :   Do nothing. Fall through to the next PAM module, even if this module is set
            as "required" or "requisite".
              
            **WARNING**: This value does not deny connections pam\_slurm\_adopt was
            unable to handle normally, which could allow users complete access to a node,
            not just to their allocated resources. This value is recommended for testing
            purposes only, we recommend using "deny" in production systems.

        **allow**
        :   Let the connection through without adoption.
              
            **WARNING**: This value explicitly allows connections pam\_slurm\_adopt was
            unable to handle normally, which could allow users complete access to a node,
            not just to their allocated resources. This value is recommended for testing
            purposes only, we recommend using "deny" in production systems.

        **deny**
        :   Deny the connection.

**disable\_x11**
:   Turn off Slurm built-in X11 forwarding support. Configurable values are:

    :   **0** (default)
        :   If the job the connection is adopted into has Slurm's X11 forwarding
            enabled, the DISPLAY variable will be overwritten with the X11 tunnel
            endpoint details.

        **1**
        :   Do not check for Slurm's X11 forwarding support, and do not alter the
            DISPLAY variable.

**join\_container**
:   Control the interaction with the namespace plugins.
    Configurable values are:

    :   **true** (default)
        :   Attempt to join a namespace created by the namespace plugins.

        **false**
        :   Do not attempt to join a namespace.

**log\_level**
:   See [SlurmdDebug](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html#OPT_SlurmdDebug) in slurm.conf for available options.
    The default log\_level is **info**.

**nodename**
:   If the NodeName defined in **slurm.conf** is different than this node's
    hostname (as reported by **hostname -s**), then this must be set to the
    NodeName in **slurm.conf** that this host operates as.

**service**
:   The pam service name for which this module should run. By default
    it only runs for sshd for which it was designed for. A
    different service name can be specified like "login" or "\*" to
    allow the module to in any service context. For local pam logins
    this module could cause unexpected behavior or even security
    issues. Therefore if the service name does not match then this
    module will not perform the adoption logic and returns
    PAM\_IGNORE immediately.

### Firewalls, IP Addresses, etc.

*slurmd* should be accessible on any IP address from which a user might
launch ssh. The RPC to determine the source job must be able to reach the
*slurmd* port on that particular IP address. If there is no *slurmd*
on the source node, such as on a [login
node](quickstart_admin.html#login), it is better to have the RPC be
rejected rather than silently dropped. This will allow better responsiveness to
the RPC initiator.

### SELinux

SELinux may conflict with pam\_slurm\_adopt, but it is generally possible for
them to work side by side. This is an example type enforcement file that was
used on a fairly stock Debian system. It is provided to give some direction
and to show what is required to get this working but may require additional
modification.

```
module pam_slurm_adopt 1.0;

require {
	type sshd_t;
	type var_spool_t;
	type unconfined_t;
	type initrc_var_run_t;
	class sock_file write;
	class dir { read search };
	class unix_stream_socket connectto;
}

#============= sshd_t ==============
allow sshd_t initrc_var_run_t:dir search;
allow sshd_t initrc_var_run_t:sock_file write;
allow sshd_t unconfined_t:unix_stream_socket connectto;
allow sshd_t var_spool_t:dir read;
allow sshd_t var_spool_t:sock_file write;
```

It is possible for some plugins to require more permissions than this.
Notably, namespace/tmpfs will require something more like this:

```
module pam_slurm_adopt 1.0;

require {
	type nsfs_t;
	type var_spool_t;
	type initrc_var_run_t;
	type unconfined_t;
	type sshd_t;
	class sock_file write;
	class dir { read search };
	class unix_stream_socket connectto;
	class fd use;
	class file read;
	class capability sys_admin;
}

#============= sshd_t ==============
allow sshd_t initrc_var_run_t:dir search;
allow sshd_t initrc_var_run_t:sock_file write;
allow sshd_t nsfs_t:file read;
allow sshd_t unconfined_t:fd use;
allow sshd_t unconfined_t:unix_stream_socket connectto;
allow sshd_t var_spool_t:dir read;
allow sshd_t var_spool_t:sock_file write;
allow sshd_t self:capability sys_admin;
```

## Limitations

Internally, some AuthenticationMethods cause sshd to fork an extra process
during the login flow, which sshd partially offloads the authentication
dialogue to. This can confuse PAM modules, and may break process adoption
with pam\_slurm\_adopt.

When using SELinux support in Slurm, the session started via pam\_slurm\_adopt
won't necessarily be in the same context as the job it is associated with.

When using namespace/linux and the user namespace is configured, the
pam\_limits module may not be able to set memlock, sigpending, msgqueue, nice, or
rtprio.
