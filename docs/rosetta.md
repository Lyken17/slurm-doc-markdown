# Rosetta Stone of Workload Managers

## PBS/Torque, Slurm, LSF, SGE and LoadLeveler

This table lists the most common command, environment variables, and
job specification options used by the major workload management systems:
PBS/Torque, Slurm, LSF, SGE and LoadLeveler.
Each of these workload managers has unique features, but the most commonly
used functionality is available in all of these environments as listed
in the table.
This should be considered a work in progress and contributions to improve
the document are welcome.
