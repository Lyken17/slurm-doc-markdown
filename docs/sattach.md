## NAME

sattach - Attach to a Slurm job step.

## SYNOPSIS

sattach [*options*] <jobid.stepid>

## DESCRIPTION

sattach attaches to a running Slurm job step. By attaching, it makes available
the IO streams of all of the tasks of a running Slurm job step. It is also
suitable for use with a parallel debugger like TotalView. It cannot be used to
attach directly to extern or batch steps since the IO channels of these steps
are not set or directly forwarded to a file.

## OPTIONS

**--error-filter**[=]<*task number*>
:   Only transmit standard input to a single task, or print the standard output
    or standard error from a single task. The filtering is performed locally in
    sattach.

    : **-h**, **--help** : Display help information and exit. : **--input-filter**[=]<*task number*> : Only transmit standard input to a single task, or print the standard output or standard error from a single task. The filtering is performed locally in sattach. : **-l**, **--label** : Prepend each line of task standard output or standard error with the task number of its origin. : **--layout** : Contacts the slurmctld to obtain the task layout information for the job step, prints the task layout information, and then exits without attaching to the job step. : **--output-filter**[=]<*task number*> : Only transmit standard input to a single task, or print the standard output or standard error from a single task. The filtering is performed locally in sattach. : **--pty** : Execute task zero in pseudo terminal. Not compatible with the **--input-filter**, **--output-filter**, or **--error-filter** options. Notes: The terminal size and resize events are ignored by sattach. Proper operation requires that the job step be initiated by srun using the --pty option. : **-Q**, **--quiet** : Suppress informational messages from sattach. Errors will still be displayed. : **-u**, **--usage** : Display brief usage message and exit. : **-V**, **--version** : Display Slurm version number and exit. : **-v**, **--verbose** : Increase the verbosity of sattach's informational messages. Multiple **-v**'s will further increase sattach's verbosity.

## PERFORMANCE

Executing **sattach** sends a remote procedure call to **slurmctld**. If
enough calls from **sattach** or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the **slurmctld** daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the **slurmctld** daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.

Do not run **sattach** or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to **slurmctld** from loops in shell scripts or other
programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to **sattach** to the minimum
necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

## INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Upon startup, salloc will read and handle the options set in the following
environment variables. Note: Command line options always override environment
variables settings.

**SLURM\_CONF**
:   The location of the Slurm configuration file.

    : **SLURM\_DEBUG\_FLAGS** : Specify debug flags for sattach to use. See DebugFlags in the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf. : **SLURM\_EXIT\_ERROR** : Specifies the exit code generated when a Slurm error occurs (e.g. invalid options). This can be used by a script to distinguish application exit codes from various Slurm error conditions.

## EXAMPLES

Attach to job 15, step 0:: : ``` $ sattach 15.0 ``` Limit the output to the 5th task of job 65386, step 15:: : ``` $ sattach --output-filter 5 65386.15 ```
