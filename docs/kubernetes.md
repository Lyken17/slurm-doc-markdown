## Overview

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is being adopted into HPC
clusters to orchestrate deployments (e.g. software, infrastructure) and run
certain workloads (e.g. AI/ML inference). There is ongoing interest in
integrating Kubernetes and Slurm to achieve a unified cluster, optimized
resource utilization, and workflows that leverage each system.

The ways in which Slurm and Kubernetes are designed to handle certain types
of workloads may change over time. Additionally, how they interact with each
other may change, allowing for new possibilities. This is still an evolving
area.
