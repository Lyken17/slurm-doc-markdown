# sreport

Section: Slurm Commands (1)  
Updated: Slurm Commands  
[Index](#index)

## NAME

sreport - Generate reports from the slurm accounting data.

## SYNOPSIS

**sreport** [*OPTIONS*...] [*COMMAND*...]

## DESCRIPTION

**sreport** is used to generate reports of job usage and cluster
utilization for Slurm jobs saved to the Slurm Database,
**slurmdbd**. Report data comes from hourly, daily, and monthly rollups of
accounting data that occur automatically in the background. Data will be pulled
from the rollup table with the longest interval that can satisfy the requested
report period. For example, a report on the time range "Start=01/01 End=03/01"
will be able to pull from the monthly rollup table, while a report with
"Start=01/01-03:00 End=03/01" will need to use the hourly rollup table.

## OPTIONS

**-a**, **--all\_clusters**
:   Use all clusters instead of only the cluster from which the command was
    executed.

    : **-M**, **--cluster** : The cluster(s) to generate reports for. Default is local cluster, unless the local cluster is currently part of a federation and in that case generate a report for all clusters in the current federation. If the clusters included in a federation vary through time, use this option to identify the clusters to be included in report. Implies --local. : **--federation** : Generate a report for the federation if a member of one. : **-h**, **--help** : Print a help message describing the usage of **sreport**. : **--local** : Generate a report for the local cluster, even if part of a federation. Overrides **--federation**. : **-n**, **--noheader** : Don't display header when listing results. : **-p**, **--parsable** : Output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end. : **-P**, **--parsable2** : Output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end. : **-Q**, **--quiet** : Print no warning or informational messages, only error messages. : **-t** <*time\_format*> : Specify the output time format. Time format options are case insensitive and may be abbreviated. The default format is Minutes. Supported time format options are listed in the **time** command section below. : **-T**, **--tres**=<*tres\_names*> : Trackable resource (TRES) to report values for. By default CPU resource use is reported (except for reservation reports. All TRES types reserved by a reservation will be shown by default unless overridden with this option). Multiple TRES names may be separated using a comma separated list for all reports except the job reports, which can only support a single TRES name, or "ALL" for all TRES. The "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest Billing TRES of each node multiplied by the time frame. For example, if a node is part of multiple partitions and each has a different TRESBillingWeights defined the Billing TRES for the node will be the highest of the partitions. If TRESBillingWeights is not defined on any partition for a node then the Billing TRES will be equal to the number of CPUs on the node. TRES node usage is no longer reported in percent format or in Cluster Utilization. Please use TRES CPU instead. The main issue with using node is in most configurations multiple jobs are able to run on the same node. This makes TRES node accounting count the same node multiple times in the same period. In exclusive node configurations, CPU accounting returns the same usage node accounting would. : **-v**, **--verbose** : Print detailed event logging. : **-V** , **--version** : Print version information and exit.

## COMMANDS

<keyword> may be omitted from the execute line and sreport will
execute in interactive mode. sreport will process commands as entered until
explicitly terminated.

**exit**
:   Terminate the execution of sreport.
    Identical to the **quit** command.

    : **help** : Display a description of sreport options and commands. : **nonparsable** : Return output to normal after parsable or parsable2 has been set. : **parsable** : Output will be | delimited with an ending '|'. : **parsable2** : Output will be | delimited without an ending '|'. : **quiet** : Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages. : **quit** : Terminate the execution of sreport. Identical to the **exit** command. : **time <time\_format>** : Specify the output time format. Time format options are case insensitive and may be abbreviated. The default format is Minutes. Supported time format options include: : : **SecPer** : Seconds/Percentage of Total : **MinPer** : Minutes/Percentage of Total : **HourPer** : Hours/Percentage of Total : **Seconds** : Seconds : **Minutes** : Minutes : **Hours** : Hours : **Percent** : Percentage of Total : **verbose** : Enable detailed event logging. : **version** : Display the sreport version number. : **!!** : Repeat the last command executed.

## REPORT TYPES

Valid report types are:

: **cluster** <REPORT> <OPTIONS> : : **job** <REPORT> <OPTIONS> : : **reservation** <REPORT> <OPTIONS> : : **user** <REPORT> <OPTIONS>

<REPORT> options for each type include:

: **cluster** : AccountUtilizationByUser, AccountUtilizationByQOS, UserUtilizationByAccount, UserUtilizationByWckey, Utilization, WCKeyUtilizationByUser : **job** : SizesByAccount, SizesByAccountAndWcKey, SizesByWckey : **reservation** : Utilization : **user** : TopUsage

**NOTE**: If **OverSubscribe** is configured to **FORCE** or **YES**
in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption
(**PreemptMode=OFF**) accounting can easily grow to values greater than
the actual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages
in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."

## REPORT DESCRIPTION

**cluster AccountUtilizationByUser**
:   :   This report will display account utilization as it appears on the
        hierarchical tree. Starting with the specified account or the
        root account by default this report will list the underlying
        usage with a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to span
        the tree for better visibility.

        **NOTE**: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts/users
        given access to it. When a reservation is assigned to whole accounts, the
        time will be counted in the association for the accounts, not the user
        associations in the accounts. In this case, the usage of a parent account can
        be larger than the sum of its children.

        : **cluster AccountUtilizationByQOS** : : This report will display account utilization as it appears on the hierarchical tree. Starting with the root account by default, or with the specified account, this report will list the underlying usage in each account, with a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to expand the tree for better visibility. Users are not displayed here, only parent accounts. **NOTE**: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts that have access to it. Since no QOS is directly connected with the idle time, the time is counted against the default QOS of the account, or 'normal' when there is no default. **NOTE**: If you reroll data in the database and have changed the default QOS on an association to something other than what was there at the time of the original rollup, you can get different data. **cluster UserUtilizationByAccount** : : This report will display users by account in order of utilization without grouping multiple accounts by user into one, but displaying them on separate lines. : **cluster UserUtilizationByWCKey** : : This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without grouping multiple wckey by user into one, but displaying them on separate lines. : **cluster Utilization** : : This report will display total usage divided amongst Allocated, Down, Planned Down, Idle, and Planned time for selected clusters. Refer to the later section for descriptions of these fields. Note: Reservations created with the IGNORE\_JOBS flag are not tracked in the Cluster Utilization report due to the fact that allowing any current/active jobs to continue to run in the reservation introduces the possibility for them to be accounted for incorrectly. The jobs in these reservations will be tracked as normal rather than being bundled in the reservation time, as they are with reservations that do not have the IGNORE\_JOBS flag. Note: The default view for the "Cluster Utilization" report includes the following fields: Cluster, Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, Idle, Planned, Reported. You can include additional fields like OverCommitted and TresCount fields with the **Format** option. The TresName will also be included if using the **-T, --tres <tres\_names>** option. : **cluster WCKeyUtilizationByUser** : : This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for each user on each cluster. : **job SizesByAccount** : : This report will display the amount of time used for job ranges specified by the 'grouping=' option. Only a single level in the tree is displayed defaulting to the root dir. If you specify other accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as the root account and you will receive the aggregated totals of each listed account plus their sub accounts. : **job SizesByAccountAndWckey** : : This report is very similar to SizesByAccount with the difference being each account is pair with wckeys so the identifier is account:wckey instead of just account so there will most likely be multiple accounts listed depending on the number of wckeys used. : **job SizesByWckey** : : This report will display the amount of time for each wckey for job ranges specified by the 'grouping=' option. : **reservation Utilization** : : This report will display total usage for reservations on the systems. Note: Time requests on this report will not truncate the time the reservation used, only the reservations that ran at any time during the period requested. : **user TopUsage** : : Displays the top users on a cluster, i.e. users with the highest usage. By default users are sorted by CPUTime, but the -T, --tres option will sort users by the first TRES specified. Use the group option to group accounts together. The default is to have a different line for each user account combination.

Each report type has various options...

**OPTIONS FOR ALL REPORT TYPES**

: **All\_Clusters** : : Use all monitored clusters. Default is local cluster. : **Clusters=<OPT>** : : List of clusters to include in report. Default is local cluster. : **End=<OPT>** : : Period ending for report. Default is 23:59:59 of previous day. Note that while minutes and seconds are recognized, they will be rounded to the previous hour as reports cannot be generated for a more specific time range. Valid time formats are... HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM] MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY] MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS] YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]] now[{+|-}*count*[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]] : **Format=<OPT>** : : Comma separated list of fields to display in report. When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed. e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right justified. A -30 will print 30 characters left justified. : **Start=<OPT>** : : Period start for report. Default is 00:00:00 of previous day. Note that while minutes and seconds are recognized, they will be rounded to the next hour as reports cannot be generated for a more specific time range. Valid time formats are... HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM] MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY] MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS] YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]] now[{+|-}*count*[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

**OPTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR CLUSTER REPORTS**

: **Accounts=<OPT>** : : When used with the UserUtilizationByAccount, or AccountUtilizationBy[User|QOS], List of accounts to include in report. Default is all. : **Tree** : : When used with the AccountUtilizationBy[User|QOS] report will span the accounts as they are in the hierarchy. : **Users=<OPT>** : : When used with any report other than Utilization, List of users to include in report. Default is all. : **Wckeys=<OPT>** : : When used with the UserUtilizationByWckey or WCKeyUtilizationByUser, List of wckeys to include in report. Default is all.

**OPTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR JOB REPORTS**

: **Accounts=<OPT>** : : List of accounts to use for the report. Default is all which will show only one line corresponding to the totals of all accounts in the hierarchy. This explanation does not apply when ran with the FlatView or AcctAsParent options. : **AcctAsParent** : : When used with the SizesbyAccount(\*) will take specified accounts as parents and the next layer of accounts under those specified will be displayed. Default is root if no specific Accounts are requested. When FlatView is used, this option is ignored. : **FlatView** : : When used with the SizesbyAccount(\*) will not group accounts in a hierarchical level, but print each account where jobs ran on a separate line without any hierarchy. : **GID=<OPT>** : : List of group ids to include in report. Default is all. : **Grouping=<OPT>** : : Comma separated list of size groupings. (e.g. 50,100,150 would group job cpu count 1-49, 50-99, 100-149, > 150). grouping=individual will result in a single column for each job size found. : **Jobs=<OPT>** : : List of jobs/steps to include in report.

## EXPLANATION OF REPORT FIELDS

**Account**
:   Account name

    : **Allocated** : **Cluster utilization report:** Time that nodes were in use with active jobs or an active reservation. This does not include reservations created with the MAINT or IGNORE\_JOBS flags. **Reservation reports:** Time that nodes were in use with active jobs in this reservation : **Associations** : Associations allowed in the reservation : **Cluster** : Cluster name : **Down** : **Cluster utilization report only:** Time that nodes were marked as Down or fully Drained, or time that slurmctld was not responding (if TrackSlurmctldDown is set in slurmdbd.conf) : **End** : **Reservation reports only:** End time : **Energy** : Energy use (if tracking energy consumption) : **Flags** : **Reservation reports only:** Flags applied to the reservation : **Idle** : **Cluster utilization report:** Time that nodes were not Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, or Planned **Reservation reports:** Time that nodes were not Allocated : **Login** : User's login name : **Name** : **Reservation reports only:** Reservation name : **OverCommitted** : **Cluster utilization report only:** Time of eligible jobs waiting in the queue over the Planned time. This contains any overflow of Planned time that would otherwise exceed the Reported time. It is typically useful to determine whether your system is overloaded and by how much. : **Planned** : **Cluster utilization report only:** Time that nodes were not Allocated, Down or PlannedDown with eligible jobs in the queue that were unable to start due to time or size constraints. If Allocated plus Planned time exceeds the Reported time, the excess will be reported as OverCommitted. If this value is not of importance for you then the number can be grouped with idle time. : **PlannedDown** : **Cluster utilization report only:** Time that nodes were in use by a reservation created with the MAINT flag but not the IGNORE\_JOBS flag. Also, time that nodes were in the FUTURE or POWERED\_DOWN state. : **Proper Name** : User's proper/real name : **Reported** : **Cluster utilization report only:** Total time that records are available for. Nodes that were added to or removed from the cluster during the report period will only contribute usage data for the time they were present in the cluster and cause percentage calculations to deviate from 100%. : **ReservationId** : **Reservation reports only:** Reservation ID : **Start** : **Reservation reports only:** Start time : **TotalTime** : **Reservation reports only:** Amount of time the reservation was valid : **TresCount** : Number of TRES present : **TresName** : Name of TRES reported : **TresTime** : **Reservation reports only:** Total TRES-time in the reservation : **Used** : Used TRES-minutes : **Wckey** : Workload Characterization Key

## PERFORMANCE

Executing **sreport** sends a remote procedure call to **slurmdbd**. If
enough calls from **sreport** or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the **slurmdbd** daemon come in at once, it can result in a
degradation of performance of the **slurmdbd** daemon, possibly resulting in a
denial of service.

Do not run **sreport** or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to **slurmdbd** from loops in shell scripts or other programs.
Ensure that programs limit calls to **sreport** to the minimum necessary for
the information you are trying to gather.

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Some **sreport** options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
(Note: Command line options will always override these settings.)

: **SREPORT\_CLUSTER** : Same as **-M**, **--cluster** : **SREPORT\_FEDERATION** : Same as --federation : **SREPORT\_LOCAL** : Same as --local : **SREPORT\_TRES** : Same as **-t, --tres** : **SLURM\_CONF** : The location of the Slurm configuration file.
