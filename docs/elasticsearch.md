# Elasticsearch Guide

Slurm provides multiple Job Completion Plugins.
These plugins are an orthogonal way to provide historical job
[accounting](accounting.md) data for finished jobs.

In most installations, Slurm is already configured with an
[AccountingStorageType](slurm.conf.md#OPT_AccountingStorageType)
plugin — usually **slurmdbd**. In these situations, the information
captured by a completion plugin is intentionally redundant.

The **jobcomp/elasticsearch** plugin can be used together with a web
layer on top of the Elasticsearch server — such as
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) — to
visualize your finished jobs and the state of your cluster. Some of these
visualization tools also let you easily create different types of dashboards,
diagrams, tables, histograms and/or apply customized filters when searching.

## Prerequisites

The plugin requires additional libraries for compilation:

* [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl) development files
* [JSON-C](related_software.md#json)

## Configuration

The Elasticsearch instance should be running and reachable from the multiple
[SlurmctldHost](slurm.conf.md#OPT_SlurmctldAddr) configured.
Refer to the [Elasticsearch
Official Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/) for further details on setup and configuration.

There are three [slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md) options related to
this plugin:

* [**JobCompType**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_JobCompType)
  is used to select the job completion plugin type to activate. It should be set
  to **jobcomp/elasticsearch**.

  ```
  JobCompType=jobcomp/elasticsearch
  ```
* [**JobCompLoc**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_JobCompLoc) should be set to
  the Elasticsearch server URL endpoint (including the port number and the target
  index).

  ```
  JobCompLoc=<host>:<port>/<target>/_doc
  ```

  **NOTE**: Since Elasticsearch 8.0 the APIs that accept types are removed,
  thereby moving to a typeless mode. The Slurm elasticsearch plugin in versions
  prior to 20.11 removed any trailing slashes from this option URL and appended
  a hardcoded **/slurm/jobcomp** suffix representing the */index/type*
  respectively.
  Starting from Slurm 20.11 the URL is fully configurable and handed as-is without
  modification to the libcurl library functions. In addition, this also allows
  users to index data from different clusters to the same server but to different
  indices.

  **NOTE**: The Elasticsearch official documentation provides detailed
  information around these concepts, the type to typeless deprecation transition
  as well as reindex API references on how to copy data from one index to another
  if needed.
* [**DebugFlags**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_DebugFlags) could include
  the **Elasticsearch** flag for extra debugging purposes.

  ```
  DebugFlags=Elasticsearch
  ```

  It is a good idea to turn this on initially until you have verified that
  finished jobs are properly indexed. Note that you do not need to manually
  create the Elasticsearch *index*, since the plugin will automatically
  do so when trying to index the first job document.

## Visualization

Once jobs are being indexed, it is a good idea to use a web visualization
layer to analyze the data.
[**Kibana**](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is a
recommended open-source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch.
Once installed, an Elasticsearch *index* name or pattern has to be
configured to instruct Kibana to retrieve the data. Once data is loaded it is
possible to create tables where each row is a finished job, ordered by
any column you choose — the @end\_time timestamp is suggested — and
any dashboards, graphs, or other analysis of interest.

## Testing and Debugging

For debugging purposes, you can use the **curl** command or any similar
tool to perform REST requests against Elasticsearch directly. Some of the
following examples using the **curl** tool may be useful.

Query information assuming a **slurm** *index* name, including the
document count (which should be one per job indexed):

```
$ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/slurm?v
health status index uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   slurm 103CW7GqQICiMQiSQv6M_g   5   1          9            0    142.8kb        142.8kb
```

Query all indexed jobs in the **slurm** *index*:

```
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/slurm/_search?pretty=true&q=*:*' | less
```

Delete the **slurm** *index* (caution!):

```
$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/slurm
{"acknowledged":true}
```

Query information about **\_cat** options. More can be found in the
official documentation.

```
$ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat
```

## Failure management

When the primary slurmctld is shut down, information about all completed but
not yet indexed jobs held within the Elasticsearch plugin saved to a
file named **elasticsearch\_state**, which is located in the
[StateSaveLocation](slurm.conf.md#OPT_StateSaveLocation). This
permits the plugin to restore the information when the slurmctld is restarted,
and will be sent to the Elasticsearch database when the connection is
restored.
