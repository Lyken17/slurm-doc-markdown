# TLS Certificate Manager

## Overview

The `certmgr` plugin interface can be used alongside the
`tls` plugin interface to dynamically create and renew signed
certificates for slurmd/sackd nodes.

Signed certificates and accompanying private keys generated with certmgr are
saved in slurmd's spool directory when they are retrieved from slurmctld, and
loaded when slurmd starts up.

## certmgr/script

The `certmgr/script` plugin allows scripts to be used to perform the
necessary operations needed to validate node identity and generate signed
certificates.

### OpenSSL Example

This is an example using the openssl cli to generate certificate signing
requests and to sign such requests to create signed certificates. This example
is not meant to be used in production, and is only mean to show the intended
responsibilities of each script.

In this example, there are a list of things that need to be preloaded on each
machine before Slurm can do its certificate management. Note that any
instructions for slurmd also apply to sackd nodes.

slurmctld will need access to the CA certificate, and the CA certificate/key
pair must be owned by `SlurmUser` (this is NOT recommended in a
production setting). See the [TLS](tls.html#s2n_openssl_example)
page for more info on how to generate this certificate/key pair.

The following scripts need to be created and configured.
See [CertmgrParameters](slurm.conf.html#OPT_CertmgrParameters) for
more details on each script.

* `get_node_token_script`
* `generate_csr_script`
* `validate_node_script`
* `sign_csr_script`

slurmctld needs to be able to validate slurmd's certificate signing request.
This is done via unique tokens that are retrieved on slurmd nodes using
`get_node_token_script`, and validated on the slurmctld host using
`validate_node_script`.

A unique token will to be generated for each slurmd. Each token will be stored
on its respective slurmd host, as well as in a comprehensive list that contains
all node tokens on the slurmctld host. This token will be sent from slurmd to
slurmctld along with the certificate signing request that slurmd will generate
at runtime, and be validated by slurmctld before slurmctld creates a signed
certificate. Note that slurmd will not begin to process any RPCs until a signed
certificate is loaded.

This is a simple example of how these tokens can be generated and stored:

```
# generate base64 32 character random token
base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 32 > ${NODENAME}_token.txt

# add token to token list
echo "`cat ${NODENAME}_token.txt`" >> node_token_list.txt
```

Node **n1** needs to boot up with `n1_token.txt` and/or have it
securely transferred to it. **slurmctld** needs to have secure access to
`node_token_list.txt` in order to validate node tokens with the
`validate_node_script`.

The `get_node_token_script`, `generate_csr_script`, and
`get_node_cert_key_script` paths need to point to scripts that exist
and are executable on slurmd nodes.

#### get\_node\_token\_script example:

Print token to stdout. Return zero exit code for success, and non-zero exit
code for error.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Slurm node name is passed in as arg $1
TOKEN_PATH=/etc/slurm/certmgr/$1_token.txt

# Check if token file exists
if [ ! -f $TOKEN_PATH ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to resolve token path '$TOKEN_PATH'"
    exit 1
fi

# Print token to stdout
cat $TOKEN_PATH

# Exit with exit code 0 to indicate success
exit 0
```

#### generate\_csr\_script example:

Print certificate signing request to stdout. Return zero exit code for success,
and non-zero exit code for error.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Slurm node name is passed in as arg $1
NODE_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/slurm/certmgr/$1_private_key.pem

# Check if node private key file exists
if [ ! -f $NODE_PRIVATE_KEY ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to resolve node private key path '$NODE_PRIVATE_KEY'"
    exit 1
fi

# Generate CSR using node private key and print CSR to stdout
openssl req -new -key $NODE_PRIVATE_KEY \
    -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=$1"

# Check exit code from openssl
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to generate CSR"
    exit 1
fi

# Exit with exit code 0 to indicate success
exit 0
```

#### get\_node\_cert\_key\_script example:

Print private key used to generate CSR to stdout. Return zero exit code for
success, and non-zero exit code for error.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Slurm node name is passed in as arg $1
NODE_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/slurm/certmgr/$1_cert_key.pem

# Check if node private key file exists
if [ ! -f $NODE_PRIVATE_KEY ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to resolve node private key path '$NODE_PRIVATE_KEY'"
    exit 1
fi

cat $NODE_PRIVATE_KEY

# Exit with exit code 0 to indicate success
exit 0
```

The `validate_node_script` and `sign_csr_script` paths
need to point to scripts that exist and are executable on **slurmctld**.

#### validate\_node\_script example:

Return zero exit code for valid node tokens, and non-zero exit code for
invalid node tokens or other errors.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Node's unique token is passed in as arg $1
NODE_TOKEN=$1
NODE_TOKEN_LIST_FILE=/etc/slurm/certmgr/node_token_list.txt

# Check if node token list file exists
if [ ! -f $NODE_TOKEN_LIST ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to resolve node token list path '$NODE_TOKEN_LIST'"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if unique node token is in token list file
grep $1 $NODE_TOKEN_LIST_FILE

# Check exit code from grep to see if token was found
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to validate token '$NODE_TOKEN'"
    exit 1
fi

# Exit with exit code 0 to indicate success (node token is valid)
exit 0
```

#### sign\_csr\_script example:

Print signed certificate to stdout. Return zero exit code for success, and
non-zero exit code for error.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Certificate signing request is passed in as arg $1
CSR=$1
CA_CERT=/etc/slurm/certmgr/root_cert.pem
CA_KEY=/etc/slurm/certmgr/root_key.pem

# Check if CA certificate file exists
if [ ! -f $CA_CERT ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to resolve CA certificate path '$CA_CERT'"
    exit 1
fi

# Check CA private key permissions
if [ `stat -c "%a" $CA_KEY` -ne $KEY_PERMISSIONS ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Bad permissions for CA private key at '$CA_KEY'. Permissions should be $KEY_PERMISSIONS"
    exit 1
fi

# Sign CSR using CA certificate and CA private key and print signed cert to stdout
openssl x509 -req -CA $CA_CERT -CAkey $CA_KEY 2>/dev/null <<< $CSR

# Check exit code from openssl
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "$BASH_SOURCE: Failed to generate signed certificate"
    exit 1
fi

# Exit with exit code 0 to indicate success
exit 0
```

If everything is configured correctly, the following lines should appear in the
slurmd and slurmctld logs with the
[DebugFlags=TLS](slurm.conf.html#OPT_TLS) setting.

slurmd:

```
slurmd: certmgr/script: certmgr_p_get_node_token: TLS: Successfully retrieved unique node token
slurmd: certmgr/script: certmgr_p_generate_csr: TLS: Successfully generated csr:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
. . .
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```

slurmctld:

```
slurmctld: certmgr/script: certmgr_p_sign_csr: TLS: Successfully validated node token
slurmctld: certmgr/script: certmgr_p_sign_csr: TLS: Successfully generated signed certificate:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
. . .
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

slurmd:

```
slurmd: TLS: Successfully got signed certificate from slurmctld:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
. . .
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

[DebugFlags=AuditTLS](slurm.conf.html#OPT_AuditTLS) can also be used
to show less verbose logs of certificate renewal.
