## OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

Slurmrestd is compliant with
[OpenAPI 3.0.2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).
The generated OAS can be viewed at the following URLs:

* /openapi.json
* /openapi.yaml
* /openapi/v3

The generated OAS can be generated directly via calling:  

* Generate OAS with only a compiled slurmrestd:  
  `env SLURM_CONF=/dev/null slurmrestd --generate-openapi-spec -s slurmctld,slurmdbd -d v0.0.40`
* Generate OAS with fully configured Slurm install:  
  `slurmrestd --generate-openapi-spec -s slurmctld,slurmdbd -d v0.0.40`

The OAS is designed to be the primary documentation for the request methods
and responses including their contents. There are several third party tools
that automatically generate documentation against the OAS output listed by
[openapi.tools](https://openapi.tools/).
An example of how to generate the docs is [here](#generated-openapi-docs).

The generated OpenAPI specification changes depending on the configuration of
slurmrestd at run time. [slurmrestd](slurmrestd.md) is a
framework, and the actual content is provided by plugins, which are optional at
runtime. However, the specific plugin versions (as noted by the v0.0.XX in the
paths) will be stable across Slurm versions, if the relevant plugin is still
present. Plugin life cycles are described
[here](upgrades.md#openapi_changes).

## OpenAPI Standard Compliance

Slurm attempts to strictly comply with the relevant
[OpenAPI standards](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md).
For reasons of compatibility, Slurm's OAS is tested against publicly available
OpenAPI client generators, but Slurm does not directly support any of them as
they are outside the control of SchedMD and may change at any time. The goal
is to comply with the standards, supporting as many clients as possible,
without favoring any one client. Sites are always welcome to write their own
clients that are OpenAPI compliant. As a rule, SchedMD will debug the HTTP
sent to and received by slurmrestd but will not directly debug any client
source code.

Tested compatibility by OpenAPI plugins:

* openapi/slurmctld:
  + [v7.3.0 of OpenAPI-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
  + [v2.4.1 of oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen)
* openapi/slurmdbd:
  + [v7.3.0 of OpenAPI-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
  + [v2.4.1 of oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen)

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS) Documentation

Slurm includes [example generated documentation](rest_api.md),
provided with each release. Slurm's documentation only includes the latest
plugins to encourage sites to develop against the latest plugins, as they
will have the longest lifespan and, by extension, the new clients will continue
to work for longer. Plugin life cycles are described
[here](upgrades.md#openapi_changes). This documentation is
generated via the following steps using
[OpenAPI-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) HTML output:

1. Generate OAS:  
   `env SLURM_CONF=/dev/null slurmrestd --generate-openapi-spec -s slurmctld,slurmdbd -d v0.0.40 > openapi.json`
2. Generate documentation:  
   `openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.json -g html -o rest_api_docs`
3. Point browser to `rest_api_docs/index.html`

Swagger provides a [web editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/)
to view and interact with the generated OAS. It makes generating clients and
documentation via
[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
relatively simple.

## Client Design

Clients should always be generated against or designed to work with specific
versions of the tagged paths from [slurmrestd](slurmrestd.md).
Client developers are strongly encouraged to not include functionality for
versions of methods not intended for use.

Client developers need to plan how to gracefully handle changes between
different Slurm versions if they plan to support multiple versions.
Slurm's method of versioning is done explicitly to allow old code to continue
to work with newer Slurm releases while that older version is still
supported. For example, v0.0.38 methods were added in Slurm-22.05 but can be
used until Slurm-24.05. While this works, these methods will not get any new
features or functionality, but generally only security fixes. Slurm will get
several new features every release, and those changes are then reflected by the
changes in the new plugin version. A client wishing to use the new features will
have to move to the newer version as new features will not be backported.

Using an OpenAPI schema generated for just one version is
advised. Many of the OpenAPI client generators have a way to strip out the
version tag from the struct names (i.e. `V0039AccountFlagsDELETED`
-> `AccountFlagsDELETED`). This could allow for a set of
unversioned base code could be created and then adjusted for material changes
in the outputted code with newer Slurm versions. Having a strongly typed
language can help with this considerably. Generally, only parts of the schema
change between different versions for specific endpoints, although looking at
a diff of them can be intimidating even if using something like
[json-diff](https://jsondiff.com/). Another option is
having wrappers to account for version differences in the same fashion as many
c libraries account for differences between Windows and Linux.

The generated OpenAPI schema can change, depending on which plugins are
present, but the versioned paths and their schemas will not (with limited
exceptions). As such, generating a schema limited to only `v0.0.40`
and placing it in your repo should result in a schema that can be used in
Slurm-23.11 to Slurm-25.05. In general, regenerating the client code and OpenAPI
schema will be counter-productive, as even the OpenAPI generators themselves can
generate different results for the same OpenAPI specification between their
versions. The same driver code would likely not even compile even though
nothing about the server has changed. An example of this
specific type of issue can be found
[here](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#action-required-the-repository-for-this-project-has-changed).

Developers may want to consider having a somewhat static set of compiled
client code in your client's code repository. That code will then only need to
be updated for revisions inside of the tagged versions, which are generally
quite rare. That will remove the need for end users to run the code generators
and limit the chances of any change disrupting your workflow.
It will also allow you to plan for upgrades at a convenient time rather than
having to ensure compatibility of multiple permutations at all times.

Developers should be aware that older versions of the versioned plugins are
removed from Slurm in a documented cadence as given
[here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/upgrades.md#openapi_changes).
Clients will need to be upgraded once the relevant plugins versions are removed
to continue to communicate with slurmrestd.

If slurmrestd compiles, then all of it will compile. Run time args to
slurmrestd and slurm.conf will, however, change the output of OAS. For instance,
if slurmdbd accounting is not configured then the `/slurmdb/` paths
will automatically **not** be included as there is an invalid prerequisite
for them. A client that queries them will get a 404 error. Slurmrestd can and
should be told to load the minimal number of plugins too (via -d and -s)
which will also change which paths are present and thus included in the OAS. To
slurmrestd, the OAS is just a form of documentation and doesn't have any
bearing to how it functions. A client could be generated with many paths that
the current running slurmrestd does not have loaded. That client will just get
404 errors for those queries and should try to avoid them via internal logic.
The client only needs to have a matching OAS for the paths/endpoints that client
will actually query. Since all endpoints in slurmrestd are versioned, there is
an automatic guarantee they will work (if present) as though the client is
querying the original slurmrestd it used to generate the original OAS it was
compiled against. If a path of the same version does not behave the same, then
that is a bug, and we kindly ask that a
[ticket be opened so we can fix it](https://support.schedmd.com).

There are very limited situations where slurmrestd will generate an OAS with
the same endpoint having different functionalities.

* If the specification is somehow fundamentally broken so that it violates the
  OpenAPI standard. Slurm has test units to try catch this but those tests are
  not perfect.
* A new field or path has been added. This should never break a client as
  clients should ignore unknown fields in JSON/YAML.

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS) changes

Changes to the OAS are always listed with every release in the
[OpenAPI Release Notes](openapi_release_notes.md).

A simple trick to see the differences between versions is to query both and
then mask the newer one, to avoid having diff list out every version tag that
changed:

```
env SLURM_CONF=/dev/null slurmrestd -d v0.0.41 -s slurmdbd,slurmctld --generate-openapi-spec > /tmp/v41.json
env SLURM_CONF=/dev/null slurmrestd -d v0.0.40 -s slurmdbd,slurmctld --generate-openapi-spec > /tmp/v40.json
cat /tmp/v41.json | sed -e 's#v0.0.41#v0.0.40#g' > /tmp/v41_masked.json
vimdiff /tmp/v40.json /tmp/v41_masked.json
jsondiff /tmp/v40.json /tmp/v41_masked.json
```

Sometimes this trick still produces too much change in the diff output to be
useful. In those cases, selecting a specific (sub)schema can be helpful:

```
jq '.components.schemas."v0.0.40_job"' /tmp/v40.json > /tmp/v40_job.json
jq '.components.schemas."v0.0.40_openapi_job_info_resp".properties.jobs.items' /tmp/v41_masked.json > /tmp/v41_masked_job.json
vimdiff /tmp/v40_job.json /tmp/v41_masked_job.json
```

The generated OpenAPI schemas are very detailed and get more detailed
every release as we add more enums, better expose possible values and
increase documentation in comments. Even minor changes to tree structure can
result in a large number of changes in the generated schema, which can be
confusing while looking at diffs. The example above shows the inlining of
`v0.0.40_job` into `v0.0.40_openapi_job_info_resp`.
Depending on the generated client, that change may not change the
resultant client code at all.

### Data Parser Lifecycle

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **data\_parser plugin** | **Added in Release** | **Removed in Release** |
| v0.0.39 | 23.02 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#23020)) | 24.11 |
| v0.0.40 | 23.11 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#23110)) | 25.11 |
| v0.0.41 | 24.05 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#24050)) | 26.05 |
| v0.0.42 | 24.11 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#24110)) | 26.11 |
| v0.0.43 | 25.05 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#25050)) | 27.05 |
| v0.0.44 | 25.11 ([release notes](openapi_release_notes.md#25110)) | 27.11 |

The data\_parser plugins are explicitly versioned with scheduled release and
removal dates in the above table. The data\_parser plugins are purposefully kept
the same between releases and instead a new incremented version is added for
every major release. This new version will be the only version to receive any
changes in any content, formatting, bug fixes, or any other behavior visible
to clients. This allows developers to keep using the same client after a Slurm
upgrade, as long as it was written for a data\_parser plugin that still exists in
the new Slurm version. The exception to this rule is that all plugins will
always receive any security related fixes according to the
[Slurm security policy](https://www.schedmd.com/security-policy/) as
with any part of Slurm. The data\_parser plugins provided upstream with Slurm in
any release are considered to have the same support as any other part of that
release.

The OpenAPI plugins (openapi/slurmctld and openapi/slurmdbd) are unversioned
and drive the data\_parser plugins to generate content. The OpenAPI plugins have
no expected removal date and will have bug fixes applied as they will not change
the presentation of the data to clients.

Planned deprecation of plugins, endpoints, parameters, fields, and values
is being documented via the
[OpenAPI standard method](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md?plain=1#L861) of setting "Deprecated: True" in generated OpenAPI
specification. Any plugin that is not marked as deprecated will continue to
exist in the next major Slurm release pending any critical issues which will be
announced separately. Any plugin marked for deprecation will be removed on the
next major release. In general, the last three plugins have been retained in
each major release with the oldest always getting marked as deprecated.

**NOTE**: Sites are always encouraged to use the latest stable plugin
version available for code development. There is no guarantee of compatibility
between different versions of the same plugin with clients. Clients should
always make sure to validate their code when migrating to newer versions of
plugins. Plugin versions will always be included in the path for every method
provided by a given plugin to ensure no two plugins will provide the same
path.

As the data\_parser plugins utilize the Slurm API internally, compatibility is
entirely based on the Slurm version. Refer to the general
[compatibility window](upgrades.md#compatibility_window)
explanation for details.

### Handling Format Changes

Any scripts or clients making use of `--json` or
`--yaml` arguments with any CLI commands may need to pass the
data\_parser version explicitly to avoid issues after an upgrade. The default
data\_parser used is the latest version which may not have a compatible format
with the prior versions. Sites can use the specification generation mode to
compare formatting differences.

```
$CLI_COMMAND --json=v0.0.41+spec_only > /tmp/v41.json;
$CLI_COMMAND --json=v0.0.40+spec_only > /tmp/v40.json;
json_diff /tmp/v40.json /tmp/v41.json;
```

In the event of a format incompatibility, the preferred data\_parser can be
requested explicitly starting with the v0.0.40 plugins in any release before
the plugin's removal.

```
$CLI_COMMAND --json=v0.0.41 $OTHER_ARGS | $SITE_SCRIPT;
$CLI_COMMAND --json=v0.0.40 $OTHER_ARGS | $SITE_SCRIPT;
$CLI_COMMAND --yaml=v0.0.41 $OTHER_ARGS | $SITE_SCRIPT;
$CLI_COMMAND --yaml=v0.0.40 $OTHER_ARGS | $SITE_SCRIPT;
```

Any `slurmrestd` web clients can determine the relevant plugin
being used by looking at the URL being queried. Example URLs:

```
http://$HOST/slurmdb/v0.0.40/jobs
http://$HOST/slurm/v0.0.40/jobs
```

The relevant data\_parser plugin in the example URLs is "v0.0.40" which
matches the `data_parser/v0.0.40` plugin. Plugin naming follows the
naming schema of `vX.X.XX` where each X is a number. The naming
schema matches the internal naming schema for Slurm's packed binary RPC layer
but is not directly related. The URLs for each given data\_parser plugins will
remain a valid query target until the plugin is removed as part of SchedMD's
commitment to ensure release limited backwards compatibility. While it should
be possible to continue using any client from a prior release while the plugins
are still supported, sites should always **recompile** any generated OpenAPI
clients and **test thoroughly** before upgrading.
