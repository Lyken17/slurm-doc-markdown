# topology.yaml

Section: Slurm Configuration File (5)  
Updated: Slurm Configuration File  
[Index](#index)

## NAME

topology.yaml - Slurm configuration file for the topology plugins

## DESCRIPTION

**topology.yaml** is a YAML-formatted configuration file that defines
multiple network topologies for optimizing job resource allocation in Slurm.
The file must be located in the same directory as **slurm.conf**. Any text
following a "#" in this file is treated as a comment through the end of that
line.

Additional details are available in **[topology.conf](topology.conf.md)**(5) and in the
Topology Guide: <<https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.html>>

**NOTE**: Slurm will first check for topology.yaml.
If this file exists, topology.conf will be ignored.

## PARAMETERS

Each topology contains the following attributes:

**topology**
:   Unique name of the topology, will be used to identify it on partition
    configurations. Must be the first attribute.

    : **cluster\_default** : The first topology defined with **cluster\_default: true** will be used for partitions without an explicitly specified topology and cluster-wide operations not tied to a partition (e.g., slurmctld-to-slurmd communication). Defaults to **false**.

Each topology must also define exactly one of the following topology types:

: **block** : This topology will use the **topology/block** plugin. Must contain additional fields, see below. : **flat** : If set to **true**, this topology will use the **topology/flat** plugin, which is the default if no TopologyPlugin or topology.yaml is specified. : **tree** : This topology will use the **topology/tree** plugin. Must contain additional fields, see below.

### Block definitions

Each block topology contains the following attributes:

**block\_sizes**
:   List of the planning base block size, alongside any
    higher-level block sizes that would be enforced.
    Successive **BlockSizes** must be a power of two larger than the prior values.

    : **blocks** : List of blocks available in this topology. Each block contains the following attributes: : **block** : The name of a block. This name is internal to Slurm and arbitrary. Each block should have a unique name. This field must be specified. : **nodes** : Child nodes of the named block.

### Tree definitions

Each tree topology contains the following attribute:

**switches**
:   List of switches available in this topology. Each switch contains the following
    attributes:

    : **switch** : The name of a switch. This name is internal to Slurm and arbitrary. Each switch should have a unique name. This field must be specified and cannot be longer than 64 characters. : **children** : Child switches of the named switch. : **nodes** : Child nodes of the named leaf switch.

## EXAMPLE

```

- topology: topo1
  cluster_default: true
  tree:
    switches:
      - switch: sw_root
        children: s[1-2]
      - switch: s1
        nodes: node[01-02]
      - switch: s2
        nodes: node[03-04]
- topology: topo2
  cluster_default: false
  block:
    block_sizes:
      - 4
      - 16
    blocks:
      - block: b1
        nodes: node[01-04]
      - block: b2
        nodes: node[05-08]
      - block: b3
        nodes: node[09-12]
      - block: b4
        nodes: node[13-16]
- topology: topo3
  cluster_default: false
  flat: true
```
