# Slurm Plugin API

## Overview

A Slurm plugin is a dynamically linked code object which is loaded explicitly
at run time by the Slurm libraries. A plugin provides a customized implementation
of a well-defined API connected to tasks such as authentication, interconnect
fabric, and task scheduling.

## Identification

A Slurm plugin identifies itself by a short character string formatted similarly
to a MIME type: *<major>/<minor>*. The major type identifies
which API the plugin implements. The minor type uniquely distinguishes a plugin
from other plugins that implement that same API, by such means as the intended
platform or the internal algorithm. For example, a plugin to interface to the
Maui scheduler would give its type as "sched/maui." It would implement
the Slurm Scheduler API.

## Versioning

Slurm plugins must provide a plugin\_version symbol exactly matching that
of the process they are loaded into. This is to avoid any potential issues if,
e.g., an underlying struct definition is changed by a maintenance release.

It is expected that the plugins are automatically build, packaged, and
distributed alongside the libslurm library, Slurm commands, and daemons.

The only exception to this is the SPANK plugin interface which only requires
the Slurm release to match, while the maintenance release (micro version) may be
changed. This is to reflect the additional ABI stability commitment that is
maintained exclusively for that plugin interface.

## Data Objects

A plugin must define and export the following symbols:

* char plugin\_type[] = "";  
  A unique, short, formatted string to identify the plugin's purpose as
  described above. A "null" plugin (i.e., one that implements the desired
  API as stubs) should have a minor type of "none."
* char plugin\_name[] = "";  
  A free-form string that identifies the plugin in human-readable terms,
  such as "Kerberos authentication." Slurm will use this string to identify
  the plugin to end users.
* const uint32\_t plugin\_version = SLURM\_VERSION\_NUMBER;  
  Identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and
  any attempt to load the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result
  in an error.
  The micro version is not considered for [SPANK](spank.md) plugins.

## API Functions in All Plugins

extern int init(void);

**Description**: If present, this function is called
just after the plugin is loaded. This allows the plugin to perform any global
initialization prior to any actual API calls.

**Arguments**: None.

**Returns**: SLURM\_SUCCESS if the plugin's initialization
was successful. Any other return value indicates to Slurm that the plugin should
be unloaded and not used.

extern void fini(void);

**Description**: If present, this function is called
just before the plugin is unloaded. This allows the plugin to do any finalization
after the last plugin-specific API call is made.

**Arguments**: None.

**Returns**: None.

**Note**: These init and fini functions are not the same as those
described in the dlopen (3) system library.
The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its own initialization.
The system \_init() is called before the Slurm
init(), and the Slurm
fini() is called before the system's
\_fini().

The functions need not appear. The plugin may provide either
init() or fini() or both.

## Thread Safety

Slurm is a multithreaded application. The Slurm plugin library may exercise
the plugin functions in a re-entrant fashion. It is the responsibility of the
plugin author to provide the necessarily mutual exclusion and synchronization
in order to avoid the pitfalls of re-entrant code.

## Run-time Support

The standard system libraries are available to the plugin. The Slurm libraries
are also available and plugin authors are encouraged to make use of them rather
than develop their own substitutes. Plugins should use the Slurm log to print
error messages.

The plugin author is responsible for specifying any specific non-standard libraries
needed for correct operation. Plugins will not load if their dependent libraries
are not available, so it is the installer's job to make sure the specified libraries
are available.

## Performance

All plugin functions are expected to execute very quickly. If any function
entails delays (e.g. transactions with other systems), it should be written to
utilize a thread for that functionality. This thread may be created by the
init() function and deleted by the
fini() functions. See **plugins/sched/backfill**
for an example of how to do this.

## Data Structure Consistency

In certain situations Slurm iterates over different data structures elements
using counters. For example, with environment variable arrays.
In order to avoid buffer overflows and other undesired situations, when a
plugin modifies certain elements it must also update these counters accordingly.
Other situations may require other types of changes.

The following advice indicates which structures have arrays with associated
counters that must be maintained when modifying data, plus other possible
important information to take in consideration when manipulating these
structures.
This list is not fully exhaustive due to constant modifications in code,
but it is a first start point and basic guideline for most common situations.
Complete structure information can be seen in the *slurm/slurm.h.in*
file.

### slurm\_job\_info\_t (job\_info\_t) Data Structure

```
  uint32_t env_size;
  char **environment;

  uint32_t spank_job_env_size;
  char **spank_job_env;

  uint32_t gres_detail_cnt;
  char **gres_detail_str;
```

These pairs of array pointers and element counters must kept updated in order
to avoid subsequent buffer overflows, so if you update the array you must
also update the related counter.

```
  char *nodes;
  int32_t *node_inx;

  int32_t *req_node_inx;
  char *req_nodes;
```

*node\_inx* and *req\_node\_inx* represents a list of index pairs for
ranges of nodes defined in the *nodes* and *req\_nodes* fields
respectively. In each case, both array variables must match the count.

```
  uint32_t het_job_id;
  char *het_job_id_set;
```

The *het\_job\_id* field should be the first element of the
*het\_job\_id\_set* array.

### job\_step\_info\_t Data Structure

```
  char *nodes;
  int32_t *node_inx;
```

*node\_inx* represents a list of index pairs for range of nodes defined in
*nodes*. Both variables must match the node count.

### priority\_factors\_object\_t Data Structure

```
  uint32_t tres_cnt;
  char **tres_names;
  double *tres_weights;
```

This value must match the configured TRES on the system, otherwise
iteration over the *tres\_names* or *tres\_weights* arrays can cause
buffer overflows.

### job\_step\_pids\_t Data Structure

```
  uint32_t pid_cnt;
  uint32_t *pid;
```

Array *pid* represents the list of Process IDs for the job step, and
*pid\_cnt* is the counter that must match the size of the array.

### slurm\_step\_layout\_t Data Structure

```
  uint32_t node_cnt;
  char *node_list;
```

The *node\_list* array size must match *node\_cnt*.

```
  uint16_t *tasks;
  uint32_t node_cnt;
  uint32_t task_cnt;
```

In the *tasks* array, each element is the number of tasks assigned
to the corresponding node, to its size must match *node\_cnt*. Moreover
*task\_cnt* represents the sum of tasks registered in *tasks*.

```
  uint32_t **tids;
```

*tids* is an array of length *node\_cnt* of task ID arrays. Each
subarray is designated by the corresponding value in the *tasks* array,
so *tasks*, *tids* and *task\_cnt* must be set to match this
layout.

### slurm\_step\_launch\_params\_t Data Structure

```
  uint32_t envc;
  char **env;
```

When modifying the environment variables in the *env* array, you must
also modify the *envc* counter accordingly to prevent buffer overflows
in subsequent loops over that array.

```
  uint32_t het_job_nnodes;
  uint32_t het_job_ntasks;

  uint16_t *het_job_task_cnts;
  uint32_t **het_job_tids;
  uint32_t *het_job_node_list;
```

This *het\_job\_\** related variables must match the current heterogeneous
job configuration.
  
For example, if for whatever reason you are reducing the number of tasks for
a node in a heterogeneous job, you should at least remove that task ID from
*het\_job\_tids*, decrement *het\_job\_ntasks* and
*het\_job\_task\_cnts*, and possibly decrement the number of nodes of the
heterogeneous job in *het\_job\_nnodes* and *het\_job\_node\_list*.

```
  char **spank_job_env;
  uint32_t spank_job_env_size;
```

When modifying the *spank\_job\_env* structure, the
*spank\_job\_env\_size* field must be updated to prevent buffer overflows
in subsequent loops over that array.

### node\_info\_t Data Structure

```
  char *features;
  char *features_act;
```

In a system containing Intel KNL processors the *features\_act* field is
set by the plugin to match the currently running modes on the node. On other
systems the *features\_act* is not usually used.
If you program such a plugin you must ensure that *features\_act* contains
a subset of *features*.

```
char *reason;
time_t reason_time;
uint32_t reason_uid;
```

If *reason* is modified then *reason\_time* and *reason\_uid*
should be updated.

### reserve\_info\_t Data Structure

```
  int32_t *node_inx;
  uint32_t node_cnt;
```

*node\_inx* represents a list of index pairs for range of nodes associated
with the reservation and its count must equal *node\_cnt*.

### partition\_info\_t Data Structure

### slurm\_step\_layout\_req\_t Data Structure

No special advice.

### slurm\_step\_ctx\_params\_t

No special advice.
