# sinfo

Section: Slurm Commands (1)  
Updated: Slurm Commands  
[Index](#index)

## NAME

sinfo - View information about Slurm nodes and partitions.

## SYNOPSIS

**sinfo** [*OPTIONS*...]

## DESCRIPTION

**sinfo** is used to view partition and node information for a
system running Slurm.

## OPTIONS

**-a**, **--all**
:   Display information about all partitions. This causes information to be
    displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
    are unavailable to the user's group.

    : **-M**, **--clusters**=<*string*> : Clusters to issue commands to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated. A value of '**all**' will query all clusters. Note that the **slurmdbd** must be up for this option to work properly, unless running in a federation with either **FederationParameters=fed\_display** configured or the **--federation** option set. This option implicitly sets the **--local** option. : **-d**, **--dead** : Only show nodes that have unexpectedly stopped responding. This may not show nodes in a POWERED\_DOWN state since they are expected to be down. : **-e**, **--exact** : If set, do not group node information on multiple nodes unless their configurations to be reported are identical. Otherwise cpu count, memory size, and disk space for nodes will be listed with the minimum value followed by a "+" for nodes with the same partition and state (e.g. "250+"). : **--federation** : Show all partitions from the federation if a member of one. : **-F**, **--future** : Report nodes in FUTURE state. : **-o**, **--format**=<*output\_format*> : Specify the information to be displayed using an **sinfo** format string. If the command is executed in a federated cluster environment and information about more than one cluster is to be displayed and the **-h, --noheader** option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default output formats shown below. Format strings transparently used by **sinfo** when running with various options are: : : *default* : : "%#P %.5a %.10l %.6D %.6t %N" : *--summarize* : : "%#P %.5a %.10l %.16F %N" : *--long* : : "%#P %.5a %.10l %.10s %.4r %.8h %.10g %.6D %.11T %.11i %N" : *--Node* : : "%#N %.6D %#P %6t" : *--long --Node* : : "%#N %.6D %#P %.11T %.4c %.8z %.6m %.8d %.6w %.8f %20E" : *--list-reasons* : : "%20E %9u %19H %N" : *--long --list-reasons* : : "%20E %12U %19H %6t %N" : In the above format strings, the use of "#" represents the maximum length of any partition name or node list to be printed. A pass is made over the records to be printed to establish the size in order to align the sinfo output, then a second pass is made over the records to print them. Note that the literal character "#" itself is not a valid field length specification, but is only used to document this behavior. The format of each field is "%[[.]size]type[suffix]" : : *size* : Minimum field size. If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used. : *.* : Indicates the output should be right justified and size must be specified. By default output is left justified. : *suffix* : Arbitrary string to append to the end of the field. Valid *type* specifications include: : : **%all** : Print all fields available for this data type with a vertical bar separating each field. : **%a** : State/availability of a partition. : **%A** : Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines. : **%b** : Features currently active on the nodes, also see **%f**. : **%B** : The max number of CPUs per node available to jobs in the partition. : **%c** : Number of CPUs per node. : **%C** : Number of CPUs by state in the format "allocated/idle/other/total". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines. : **%d** : Size of temporary disk space per node in megabytes. : **%D** : Number of nodes. : **%e** : The total memory, in MB, currently free on the node as reported by the OS. This value is for informational use only and is not used for scheduling. : **%E** : The reason a node is unavailable (down, drained, or draining states). : **%f** : Features available the nodes, also see **%b**. : **%F** : Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle/other/total". Note the use of this format option with a node state format option ("%t" or "%T") will result in the different node states being be reported on separate lines. : **%g** : Groups which may use the nodes. : **%G** : Generic resources (gres) associated with the nodes. : **%h** : Print the OverSubscribe setting for the partition. : **%H** : Print the timestamp of the reason a node is unavailable. : **%i** : If a node is in an advanced reservation print the name of that reservation. : **%I** : Partition job priority weighting factor. : **%l** : Maximum time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds" : **%L** : Default time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds" : **%m** : Size of memory per node in megabytes. : **%M** : PreemptionMode. : **%n** : List of node hostnames. : **%N** : List of node names. : **%o** : List of node communication addresses. : **%O** : CPU load of a node as reported by the OS. : **%p** : Partition scheduling tier priority. : **%P** : Partition name followed by "\*" for the default partition, also see **%R**. : **%r** : Only user root may initiate jobs, "yes" or "no". : **%R** : Partition name, also see **%P**. : **%s** : Maximum job size in nodes. : **%S** : Allowed allocating nodes. : **%t** : State of nodes, compact form. : **%T** : State of nodes, extended form. : **%u** : Print the user name of who set the reason a node is unavailable. : **%U** : Print the user name and uid of who set the reason a node is unavailable. : **%v** : Print the running slurmd version. If reporting on a node list, print the version of the first node in the list. : **%V** : Print the cluster name if running in a federation. : **%w** : Scheduling weight of the nodes. : **%X** : Number of sockets per node. : **%Y** : Number of cores per socket. : **%Z** : Number of threads per core. : **%z** : Extended processor information: number of sockets, cores, threads (S:C:T) per node. : **-O**, **--Format**=<*output\_format*> : Specify the information to be displayed. Also see the **-o <output\_format>**, **--format=<output\_format>** option (which supports greater flexibility in formatting, but does not support access to all fields because we ran out of letters). Requests a comma separated list of job information to be displayed. The format of each field is "type[:[.][size][suffix]]" : : *size* : The maximum field size. If no size is specified, 20 characters will be allocated to print the information. : *.* : Indicates the output should be right justified and size must be specified. By default, output is left justified. : *suffix* : Arbitrary string to append to the end of the field. Valid *type* specifications include: : : **All** : Print all fields available in the -o format for this data type with a vertical bar separating each field. : **AllocMem** : Prints the amount of allocated memory on a node. : **AllocNodes** : Allowed allocating nodes. : **Available** : State/availability of a partition. : **Cluster** : Print the cluster name if running in a federation. : **Comment** : Comment.

Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines. : **DefaultTime** : Default time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds". : **Disk** : Size of temporary disk space per node in megabytes. : **Extra** : Arbitrary string on the node. : **Features** : Features available on the nodes. Also see **features\_act**. : **features\_act** : Features currently active on the nodes. Also see **features**. : **FreeMem** : The total memory, in MB, currently free on the node as reported by the OS. This value is for informational use only and is not used for scheduling. : **Gres** : Generic resources (gres) associated with the nodes. : **GresUsed** : Generic resources (gres) currently in use on the nodes. : **Groups** : Groups which may use the nodes. : **MaxCPUsPerNode** : The max number of CPUs per node available to jobs in the partition. : **Memory** : Size of memory per node in megabytes. : **NodeAddr** : List of node communication addresses. : **NodeAI** : Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines. : **NodeAIOT** : Number of nodes by state in the format "allocated/idle/other/total". Do not use this with a node state option ("%t" or "%T") or the different node states will be placed on separate lines. : **NodeHost** : List of node hostnames. : **NodeList** : List of node names. : **Nodes** : Number of nodes. : **OverSubscribe** : Whether jobs may oversubscribe compute resources (e.g. CPUs). : **Partition** : Partition name followed by "\*" for the default partition, also see **%R**. : **PartitionName** : Partition name, also see **%P**. : **Port** : Node TCP port. : **PreemptMode** : Preemption mode. : **PriorityJobFactor** : Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority. : **PriorityTier** or **Priority** : Partition scheduling tier priority. : **Reason** : The reason a node is unavailable (down, drained, or draining states). : **Root** : Only user root may initiate jobs, "yes" or "no". : **Size** : Maximum job size in nodes. : **SocketCoreThread** : Extended processor information: number of sockets, cores, threads (S:C:T) per node. : **Sockets** : Number of sockets per node. : **StateCompact** : State of nodes, compact form. : **StateLong** : State of nodes, extended form. : **StateComplete** : State of nodes, including all node state flags. e.g. "idle+cloud+power" : **Threads** : Number of threads per core. : **Time** : Maximum time for any job in the format "days-hours:minutes:seconds". : **TimeStamp** : Print the timestamp of the reason a node is unavailable. : **User** : Print the user name of who set the reason a node is unavailable. : **UserLong** : Print the user name and uid of who set the reason a node is unavailable. : **Version** : Print the running slurmd version. If reporting on a node list, print the version of the first node in the list. : **Weight** : Scheduling weight of the nodes. : **--help** : Print a message describing all **sinfo** options. : **--hide** : Do not display information about hidden partitions. Partitions that are configured as hidden or are not available to the user's group will not be displayed. This is the default behavior. : **-i**, **--iterate**=<*seconds*> : Print the state on a periodic basis. Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports. By default prints a time stamp with the header. : **--json**, **--json**=*list*, **--json**=<*data\_parser*> : Dump information as JSON using the default data\_parser plugin or explicit data\_parser with parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be. Sorting and formatting arguments passed to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used. : **-R**, **--list-reasons** : List reasons nodes are in the down, drained, fail or failing state. When nodes are in these states Slurm supports the inclusion of a "reason" string by an administrator. This option will display the first 20 characters of the reason field and list of nodes with that reason for all nodes that are, by default, down, drained, draining or failing. This option may be used with other node filtering options (e.g. **-r**, **-d**, **-t**, **-n**), however, combinations of these options that result in a list of nodes that are not down or drained or failing will not produce any output. When used with **-l** the output additionally includes the current node state. : **--local** : Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation (if any). Overrides **--federation**. : **-l**, **--long** : Print more detailed information. This is ignored if the **--format** option is specified. : **--noconvert** : Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G). : **-N**, **--Node** : Print information in a node-oriented format with one line per node and partition. That is, if a node belongs to more than one partition, then one line for each node-partition pair will be shown. If **--partition** is also specified, then only one line per node in this partition is shown. The default is to print information in a partition-oriented format. This is ignored if the **--format** option is specified. : **-n**, **--nodes**=<*nodes*> : Print information about the specified node(s). Multiple nodes may be comma separated or expressed using a node range expression (e.g. "linux[00-17]") Limiting the query to just the relevant nodes can measurably improve the performance of the command for large clusters. : **-h**, **--noheader** : Do not print a header on the output. : **-p**, **--partition**=<*partition*> : Print information about the node(s) in the specified partition(s). Multiple partitions are separated by commas. : **-T**, **--reservation** : Only display information about Slurm reservations. **NOTE**: This option causes **sinfo** to ignore most other options, which are focused on partition and node information. : **-r**, **--responding** : Exclude any nodes that have unexpectedly stopped responding. This is the opposite of **--dead**. : **-S**, **--sort**=<*sort\_list*> : Specification of the order in which records should be reported. This uses the same field specification as the <output\_format>. Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields separated by commas. The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "-" for ascending (default) and descending order respectively. The partition field specification, "P", may be preceded by a "#" to report partitions in the same order that they appear in Slurm's configuration file, **slurm.conf**. For example, a sort value of "+P,-m" requests that records be printed in order of increasing partition name and within a partition by decreasing memory size. The default value of sort is "#P,-t" (partitions ordered as configured then decreasing node state). If the **--Node** option is selected, the default sort value is "N" (increasing node name). : **-t**, **--states**=<*states*> : List nodes only having the given state(s). Multiple states may be comma separated and the comparison is case insensitive. If the states are separated by '+', then the nodes must be in all states. The state can be prefixed with '~' which will invert the result of match. Possible values include (case insensitive): ALLOC, ALLOCATED, BLOCKED, CLOUD, COMP, COMPLETING, DOWN, DRAIN (for node in DRAINING or DRAINED states), DRAINED, DRAINING, FAIL, FUTURE, FUTR, IDLE, MAINT, MIX, MIXED, NO\_RESPOND, NPC, PERFCTRS, PLANNED, POWER\_DOWN, POWERING\_DOWN, POWERED\_DOWN, POWERING\_UP, REBOOT\_ISSUED, REBOOT\_REQUESTED, RESV, RESERVED, UNK, and UNKNOWN. By default nodes in the specified state are reported whether they are responding or not. The **--dead** and **--responding** options may be used to filter nodes by the corresponding flag. : **-s**, **--summarize** : List only a partition state summary with no node state details. This is ignored if the **--format** option is specified. : **--usage** : Print a brief message listing the **sinfo** options. : **-v**, **--verbose** : Provide detailed event logging through program execution. : **-V**, **--version** : Print version information and exit. : **--yaml**, **--yaml**=*list*, **--yaml**=<*data\_parser*> : Dump information as YAML using the default data\_parser plugin or explicit data\_parser with parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be. Sorting and formatting arguments passed to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.

## OUTPUT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS

**AVAIL**
:   Partition state. Can be either **up**, **down**, **drain**, or **inact**
    (for INACTIVE). See the partition definition's **State** parameter in the
    **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information.

    : **CPUS** : Count of CPUs (processors) on these nodes. : **S:C:T** : Count of sockets (S), cores (C), and threads (T) on these nodes. : **SOCKETS** : Count of sockets on these nodes. : **CORES** : Count of cores on these nodes. : **THREADS** : Count of threads on these nodes. : **GROUPS** : Resource allocations in this partition are restricted to the named groups. **all** indicates that all groups may use this partition. : **JOB\_SIZE** : Minimum and maximum node count that can be allocated to any user job. A single number indicates the minimum and maximum node count are the same. **infinite** is used to identify partitions without a maximum node count. : **TIMELIMIT** : Maximum time limit for any user job in days-hours:minutes:seconds. **infinite** is used to identify partitions without a job time limit. : **MEMORY** : Size of real memory in megabytes on these nodes. : **NODELIST** : Names of nodes associated with this particular configuration. : **NODES** : Count of nodes with this particular configuration. : **NODES(A/I)** : Count of nodes with this particular configuration by node state in the form "allocated/idle". : **NODES(A/I/O/T)** : Count of nodes with this particular configuration by node state in the form "allocated/idle/other/total". : **PARTITION** : Name of a partition. Note that the suffix "\*" identifies the default partition. : **PORT** : Local TCP port used by slurmd on the node. : **ROOT** : Is the ability to allocate resources in this partition restricted to user root, **yes** or **no**. : **OVERSUBSCRIBE** : Whether jobs allocated resources in this partition can/will oversubscribe those compute resources (e.g. CPUs). **NO** indicates resources are never oversubscribed. **EXCLUSIVE** indicates whole nodes are dedicated to jobs (equivalent to srun --exclusive option, may be used even with select/cons\_tres managing individual processors). **FORCE** indicates resources are always available to be oversubscribed. **YES** indicates resource may be oversubscribed, if requested by the job's resource allocation. **NOTE**: If OverSubscribe is set to FORCE or YES, the OversubScribe value will be appended to the output. : **STATE** : State of the nodes. Possible states include: allocated, blocked, completing, down, drained, draining, fail, failing, future, idle, maint, mixed, perfctrs, planned, power\_down, power\_up, reserved, and unknown. Their abbreviated forms are: alloc, block, comp, down, drain, drng, fail, failg, futr, idle, maint, mix, npc, plnd, pow\_dn, pow\_up, resv, and unk respectively. **NOTE**: The suffix "\*" identifies nodes that are presently not responding. : **TMP\_DISK** : Size of temporary disk space in megabytes on these nodes.

## NODE STATE CODES

Node state codes are shortened as required for the field size.
These node states may be followed by a special character to identify
state flags associated with the node.
The following node suffixes and states are used:

**\***
:   The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
    any new work. If the node remains non-responsive, it will
    be placed in the **DOWN** state (except in the case of
    **COMPLETING**, **DRAINED**, **DRAINING**,
    **FAIL**, **FAILING** nodes).

    : **~** : The node is presently in powered off. : **#** : The node is presently being powered up or configured. : **!** : The node is pending power down. : **%** : The node is presently being powered down. : **$** : The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance". : **@** : The node is pending reboot. : **^** : The node reboot was issued. : **-** : The node is planned by the backfill scheduler for a higher priority job. : **ALLOCATED** : The node has been allocated to one or more jobs. : **ALLOCATED+** : The node is allocated to one or more active jobs plus one or more jobs are in the process of COMPLETING. : **BLOCKED** : The node has been blocked by exclusive topo job. : **COMPLETING** : All jobs associated with this node are in the process of COMPLETING. This node state will be removed when all of the job's processes have terminated and the Slurm epilog program (if any) has terminated. See the **Epilog** parameter description in the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **DOWN** : The node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically place nodes in this state if some failure occurs. System administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If a node resumes normal operation, Slurm can automatically return it to service. See the **ReturnToService** and **SlurmdTimeout** parameter descriptions in the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **DRAINED** : The node is unavailable for use per system administrator request. See the **update node** command in the **[scontrol](scontrol.md)**(1) man page or the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **DRAINING** : The node is currently allocated a job, but will not be allocated additional jobs. The node state will be changed to state **DRAINED** when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter this state per system administrator request. See the **update node** command in the **[scontrol](scontrol.md)**(1) man page or the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **FAIL** : The node is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for use per system administrator request. See the **update node** command in the **[scontrol](scontrol.md)**(1) man page or the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **FAILING** : The node is currently executing a job, but is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for use per system administrator request. See the **update node** command in the **[scontrol](scontrol.md)**(1) man page or the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for more information. : **FUTURE** : The node is currently not fully configured, but expected to be available at some point in the indefinite future for use. : **IDLE** : The node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use. : **INVAL** : The node did not register correctly with the controller. This happens when a node registers with less resources than configured in the slurm.conf file. The node will clear from this state with a valid registration (i.e. a slurmd restart is required). : **MAINT** : The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance". : **REBOOT\_ISSUED** : A reboot request has been sent to the agent configured to handle this request. : **REBOOT\_REQUESTED** : A request to reboot this node has been made, but hasn't been handled yet. : **MIXED** : The node has some of its CPUs **ALLOCATED** while others are **IDLE**. Or the node has a suspended job allocated to some of its TRES (e.g. memory). : **PERFCTRS (NPC)** : Network Performance Counters associated with this node are in use, rendering this node as not usable for any other jobs : **PLANNED** : The node is planned by the backfill scheduler for a higher priority job. : **POWER\_DOWN** : The node is pending power down. : **POWERED\_DOWN** : The node is currently powered down and not capable of running any jobs. : **POWERING\_DOWN** : The node is in the process of powering down and not capable of running any jobs. : **POWERING\_UP** : The node is in the process of being powered up. : **RESERVED** : The node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available. : **UNKNOWN** : The Slurm controller has just started and the node's state has not yet been determined.

## PERFORMANCE

Executing **sinfo** sends a remote procedure call to **slurmctld**. If
enough calls from **sinfo** or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the **slurmctld** daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the **slurmctld** daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.

Do not run **sinfo** or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to **slurmctld** from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to **sinfo** to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Some **sinfo** options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
**NOTE**: Command line options will always override these settings.

**SINFO\_ALL**
:   Same as **-a, --all**

    : **SINFO\_FEDERATION** : Same as **--federation** : **SCONTROL\_FUTURE** : **-F, --future** : **SINFO\_FORMAT** : Same as **-o <output\_format>, --format=<output\_format>** : **SINFO\_LOCAL** : Same as **--local** : **SINFO\_PARTITION** : Same as **-p <partition>, --partition=<partition>** : **SINFO\_SORT** : Same as **-S <sort>, --sort=<sort>** : **SLURM\_CLUSTERS** : Same as **--clusters** : **SLURM\_CONF** : The location of the Slurm configuration file. : **SLURM\_DEBUG\_FLAGS** : Specify debug flags for sinfo to use. See DebugFlags in the **[slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md)**(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf. : **SLURM\_JSON** : Control JSON serialization: : : **compact** : Output JSON as compact as possible. : **pretty** : Output JSON in pretty format to make it more readable. **SLURM\_TIME\_FORMAT** : Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of *standard*, the default value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second". A value of *relative* returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day. For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by "Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr"). For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g. "6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format. A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56"). : **SLURM\_YAML** : Control YAML serialization: : : **compact** Output YAML as compact as possible. : : **pretty** Output YAML in pretty format to make it more readable.

## EXAMPLES
