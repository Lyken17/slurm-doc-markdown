# Slurm APIs

### Overview

All of the Slurm commands utilize a collection of Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) exposed through the "slurm.h" and "slurmdb.h" headers.
Slurm's APIs are fixed within each major release. They do change —
significantly — between each major release.

Developers are encouraged to target Slurm's [REST API](rest_api.md) which provides for broader cross-version compatibility.
