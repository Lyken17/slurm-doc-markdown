# nss\_slurm

nss\_slurm is an optional NSS plugin that can permit passwd, group and
cloud node host
resolution for a job on the compute node to be serviced through the local
slurmstepd process, rather than through some alternate network-based service
such as LDAP, DNS, SSSD, or NSLCD.

When enabled on the cluster, for each job, the job's user will have their
full **struct passwd** info — username, uid, primary gid, gecos info,
home directory, and shell — securely sent as part of each step launch,
and cached within the slurmstepd process. This info will then be provided to
any process launched by that step through the
**getpwuid()**/**getpwnam()**/**getpwent()** system calls.

For group information — from the
**getgrgid()**/**getgrnam()**/**getgrent()** system calls —,
an abbreviated view of **struct group** will be provided. Within a given
process, the response will include only those groups that the user belongs to,
but with only the user themselves listed as a member. The full list of group
members is not provided.

For host information — from the
**gethostbyname()**/**gethostbyname** system calls —,
an abbreviated view of **struct hostent** will be provided. Within a given
process, the response will include only the cloud hosts that belong to
allocation.

All of this information is populated by slurmctld as it is seen on the
host running slurmctld.

## Installation

### Source:

In your Slurm build directory, navigate to **contribs/nss\_slurm/**
and run:

```
make && make install
```

This will install libnss\_slurm.so.2 alongside your other Slurm library files
in your install path.

Depending on your Linux distribution, you will likely need to symlink this
to the directory which includes your other NSS plugins to enable it.
On Debian/Ubuntu, /lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu is
recommended, and for RHEL-based distributions
/usr/lib64 is recommended. If in doubt,
a command such as
find /lib /usr/ -name 'libnss\*' should help.

## Setup

The slurmctld must be configured to look up and send the appropriate passwd
and group details as part of the launch credential. This is handled by setting
**LaunchParameters=enable\_nss\_slurm** in slurm.conf and restarting
slurmctld.

Once enabled, the scontrol getent command
can be used on a compute node to print all passwd and group info associated
with job steps on that node. As an example:

```
tim@node0001:~$ scontrol getent node0001
JobId=1268.Extern:
User:
tim:x:1000:1000:Tim Wickberg:/home/tim:/bin/bash
Groups:
tim:x:1000:tim
projecta:x:1001:tim

JobId=1268.0:
User:
tim:x:1000:1000:Tim Wickberg:/home/tim:/bin/bash
Groups:
tim:x:1000:tim
projecta:x:1001:tim
```

## NSS Slurm Configuration

nss\_slurm has an optional configuration file —
**/etc/nss\_slurm.conf**. This configuration file is only needed if:

* The node's hostname does not match the NodeName, in which case you must
  explicitly set the NodeName option.
* The SlurmdSpoolDir does not match Slurm's default location of
  **/var/spool/slurmd**, in which case it must be provided as well.

NodeName and SlurmdSpoolDir are the only configuration options supported
at this time.

## Initial Testing

Before enabling NSS Slurm directly on the node, you should use the
**-s slurm** option to **getent** within a newly launched job step
to verify that the rest of the setup has been completed successfully. The
**-s** option to getent allows it to query a specific database —
even if it has not been enabled by default through the system's
**nsswitch.conf**. Note that nss\_slurm only responds to requests from
processes within the job step itself — you must launch the getent
command within a job step to see any data returned.

As an example of a successful query:

```
tim@blackhole:~$ srun getent -s slurm passwd
tim:x:1000:1000:Tim Wickberg:/home/tim:/bin/bash
tim@blackhole:~$ srun getent -s slurm group
tim:x:1000:tim
projecta:x:1001:tim
```

## NSS Configuration

Enabling nss\_slurm is as simple as adding **slurm** to the passwd and
group database in **/etc/nsswitch.conf** (only on systems that will run
**slurmd**). It is recommended that
**slurm** is listed first, as the order (from left to right) determines
the sequence in which the NSS databases will be queried, and this ensures Slurm
handles the request if able before submitting the query to other sources.

To enable cloud node name resolution **slurm** needs to be added to the
to hosts database in **/etc/nsswitch.conf**.
It is recommended that **slurm** is listed last.

Once enabled, test it by launching **getent** queries such as:

```
tim@blackhole:~$ srun getent passwd tim
tim:x:1000:1000:Tim Wickberg:/home/tim:/bin/bash
tim@blackhole:~$ srun getent group projecta
projecta:x:1001:tim
```

## Limitations

nss\_slurm will only return results for processes within a given job step.
It will not return any results for processes outside of these steps, such as
system monitoring, node health checks, prolog or epilog scripts, and related
node system processes.

nss\_slurm is not meant as a full replacement for network directory services
such as LDAP, but as a way to remove load from those systems to improve the
performance of large-scale job launches. It accomplishes this by removing
the "thundering-herd" issue should all tasks of a large job make simultaneous
lookup requests — generally for info related to the user themselves,
which is the only information nss\_slurm will be able to provide — and
overwhelm the underlying directory services.

nss\_slurm is only able to communicate with a single slurmd. If running
with --enable-multiple-slurmd, you can specify which slurmd is used with NodeName
and SlurmdSpoolDir parameters in the **nss\_slurm.conf** file.

Since the information is gathered from the slurmctld node, there can be
unexpected consequences if the information differs between the controller and
the worker nodes. One possible scenario is if a user's shell is /sbin/nologin
on the slurmctld machine but /bin/bash on the slurmd node. An interactive
salloc may fail to launch since it will try to spawn the default shell,
which according to the slurmctld is /sbin/nologin.

When using proctrack/pgid, nss\_slurm will rely on the pgid of the process
to determine if it can respond to that request. The login shell spawned with
srun --pty must be run in its own session,
and therefore its own pgid, so nss\_slurm will not respond to requests in an
interactive session.
