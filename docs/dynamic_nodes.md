# Dynamic Nodes

## Overview

Starting in Slurm 22.05, nodes can be dynamically added and removed from
Slurm.

## Dynamic Node Communications

For regular, non-dynamically created nodes, Slurm knows how to communicate with
nodes by reading in the slurm.conf. This is why it is important for a
non-dynamic setup that the slurm.conf is synchronized across the cluster. For
dynamically created nodes, The controller automatically grabs the node's
**NodeAddr** and **NodeHostname** for dynamic slurmd registrations. The
controller then passes the node addresses to the clients so that they
communicate, and even fanout, to other nodes.

## Slurm Configuration

**MaxNodeCount=#**: Set to the number of possible nodes that can be active in a system at a time. See the slurm.conf [man](slurm.conf.md#OPT_MaxNodeCount) page for more details. **SelectType=select/cons\_tres**: Dynamic nodes are only supported with cons\_tres.

### Partition Assignment

Dynamic nodes can be automatically assigned to partitions at creation by using
the partition's nodes [ALL](slurm.conf.md#OPT_Nodes_1) keyword or
[NodeSets](slurm.conf.md#SECTION_NODESET-CONFIGURATION) and
specifying a feature on the nodes.

e.g.

```
Nodeset=ns1 Feature=f1
Nodeset=ns2 Feature=f2

PartitionName=all  Nodes=ALL Default=yes
PartitionName=dyn1 Nodes=ns1
PartitionName=dyn2 Nodes=ns2
PartitionName=dyn3 Nodes=ns1,ns2
```

## Creating Nodes

Nodes can be created two ways:

1. **Dynamic slurmd registration**: Using the slurmd [-Z](slurmd.md#OPT_-Z) and [--conf](slurmd.md#OPT_conf-<node-parameters>) options a slurmd will register with the controller and will automatically be added to the system. e.g. ``` slurmd -Z --conf "RealMemory=80000 Gres=gpu:2 Feature=f1" ```
2. **scontrol create NodeName= ...**: Create nodes using scontrol by specifying the same **NodeName** line that you would define in the slurm.conf. See slurm.conf [man](slurm.conf.md#SECTION_NODE-CONFIGURATION) page for node options. Only **State=CLOUD** and **State=FUTURE** are supported. The node configuration should match what the slurmd will register with (e.g. slurmd -C) plus any additional attributes.

e.g.

```
scontrol create NodeName=d[1-100] CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=31848 Gres=gpu:2 Feature=f1 State=cloud
```

## Deleting Nodes

Nodes can be deleted using **scontrol delete nodename=<nodelist>**.
Only dynamic nodes that have no running jobs and that are not part of a
reservation can be deleted.

## Topology

Nodes can be dynamically added to and removed from topologies as described in
the [Topology Guide](topology.md).

## Limitations

1. Dynamic nodes are not sorted internally and when added to Slurm they will
   potentially be alphabetically out of order internally — leading to
   suboptimal job allocations if node names represent topology of the nodes.
