## Overview

Slurm can be configured to collect accounting information for every
job and job step executed.
Accounting records can be written to a simple text file or a database.
Information is available about both currently executing jobs and
jobs which have already terminated.
The **sacct** command can report resource usage for running or terminated
jobs including individual tasks, which can be useful to detect load imbalance
between the tasks.
The **sstat** command can be used to status only currently running jobs.
It also can give you valuable information about imbalance between tasks.
The **sreport** can be used to generate reports based upon all jobs
executed in a particular time interval.

There are three distinct plugin types associated with resource accounting.
The Slurm configuration parameters (in *slurm.conf*) associated with
these plugins include:

* **AccountingStorageType** controls how detailed job and job
  step information is recorded. You can store this information in a
  text file or into SlurmDBD.
* **JobAcctGatherType** is operating system dependent and
  controls what mechanism is used to collect accounting information.
  Supported values are *jobacct\_gather/linux*,
  *jobacct\_gather/cgroup* and *jobacct\_gather/none*
  (no information collected).
* **JobCompType** controls how job completion information is
  recorded. This can be used to record basic job information such
  as job name, user name, allocated nodes, start time, completion
  time, exit status, etc. If the preservation of only basic job
  information is required, this plugin should satisfy your needs
  with minimal overhead. You can store this information in a text file,
  or [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) or MariaDB database.

The use of sacct to view information about jobs
is dependent upon AccountingStorageType
being configured to collect and store that information.
The use of sreport is dependent upon some database being
used to store that information.

The use of sacct or sstat to view information about resource usage
within jobs is dependent upon both JobAcctGatherType and AccountingStorageType
being configured to collect and store that information.

Storing the accounting information into text files is
very simple. Just configure the appropriate plugin (e.g.
*JobCompType=jobcomp/filetxt*) and then specify the
pathname of the file (e.g. *JobCompLoc=/var/log/slurm/job\_completions*).
Use the *logrotate* or similar tool to prevent the
log files from getting too large.
Send a SIGUSR2 signal to the *slurmctld* daemon
after moving the files, but before compressing them so
that new log files will be created.

Storing the data directly into a database from Slurm may seem
attractive, but it requires the availability of user name and
password data not only for the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld),
but also for user commands which need to access the data (sacct, sreport, and
sacctmgr).
Making potentially sensitive information available to all users makes
database security more difficult to provide. Sending the data through
an intermediate daemon can provide better security and performance
(through caching data). SlurmDBD (Slurm Database Daemon) provides such services.
SlurmDBD is written in C, multi-threaded, secure and fast.
The configuration required to use SlurmDBD will be described below.
Storing information directly into a database would be similar.

Note that SlurmDBD relies upon existing Slurm plugins
for authentication and Slurm SQL for database use, but the other Slurm
commands and daemons are not required on the host where
SlurmDBD is installed. Install the *slurm* and *slurm-slurmdbd*
RPMs on the server where SlurmDBD is to run.

Note if you switch from using the MySQL plugin to use the SlurmDBD plugin
you must make sure the cluster has been added to the database. The MySQL
plugin doesn't require this, but also will not hurt things if you have it
there when using the MySQL plugin. You can verify with

```
sacctmgr list cluster
```

If the cluster isn't there, add it (where my cluster's name was
snowflake):

```
sacctmgr add cluster snowflake
```

Failure to do so will result in the slurmctld failing to talk to the slurmdbd
after the switch. If you plan to upgrade to a new version of Slurm don't switch
plugins at the same time or you may get unexpected results. Do one then the
other.

If SlurmDBD is configured for use but not responding then *slurmctld*
will utilize an internal cache until SlurmDBD is returned to service.
The cached data is written by *slurmctld* to local storage upon shutdown
and recovered at startup.
If SlurmDBD is not available when *slurmctld* starts, a cache of
valid accounts, user limits, etc. based upon their state when the
daemons were last communicating will be used.
Note that SlurmDBD must be responding when *slurmctld* is first started
since no cache of this critical data will be available.
Job and step accounting records generated by *slurmctld* will be
written to a cache as needed and transferred to SlurmDBD when returned to
service. Note that if SlurmDBD is down long enough for the number of queued
records to exceed the maximum queue size then messages will begin to be
dropped.

## Infrastructure

With the SlurmDBD, we are able to collect data from multiple
clusters in a single location.
This does impose some constraints on the user naming and IDs.
Accounting is maintained by user name (not user ID), but a
given user name should refer to the same person across all
of the computers.
Authentication relies upon user ID numbers, so those must
be uniform across all computers communicating with each
SlurmDBD, at least for users requiring authentication.
In particular, the configured *SlurmUser* must have the
same name and ID across all clusters.
If you plan to have administrators of user accounts, limits,
etc. they must also have consistent names and IDs across all
clusters.
If you plan to restrict access to accounting records (e.g.
only permit a user to view records of his jobs), then all
users should have consistent names and IDs.

**NOTE**: By default only lowercase usernames are supported, but you
can configure **Parameters=PreserveCaseUser** in your slurmdbd.conf to
allow usernames with uppercase characters.

The best way to ensure security of the data is by authenticating
communications to the SlurmDBD and we recommend
[MUNGE](https://dun.github.io/munge/) for that purpose.
If you have one cluster managed by Slurm and execute the SlurmDBD
on that one cluster, the normal MUNGE configuration will suffice.
Otherwise MUNGE should then be installed on all nodes of all
Slurm managed clusters, plus the machine where SlurmDBD executes.
You then have a choice of either having a single MUNGE key for
all of these computers or maintaining a unique key for each of the
clusters plus a second key for communications between the clusters
for better security.
MUNGE enhancements are planned to support two keys within a single
configuration file, but presently two different daemons must be
started with different configurations to support two different keys
(create two key files and start the daemons with the
*--key-file* option to locate the proper key plus the
*--socket* option to specify distinct local domain sockets for each).
The pathname of local domain socket will be needed in the Slurm
and SlurmDBD configuration files (slurm.conf and slurmdbd.conf
respectively, more details are provided below).

Whether you use any authentication module or not you will need to have
a way for the SlurmDBD to get UIDs for users and/or admins. If using
MUNGE, it is ideal for your users to have the same id on all your
clusters. If this is the case you should have a combination of every cluster's
/etc/passwd file on the database server to allow the DBD to resolve
names for authentication. If using MUNGE and a user's name is not in
the passwd file the action will fail. If not using MUNGE, you should
add anyone you want to be an administrator or operator to the passwd file.
If they plan on running sacctmgr or any of the accounting tools they
should have the same UID, or they will not authenticate correctly. An
LDAP server could also serve as a way to gather this information.

### Storage Backup Host

A backup instance of slurmdbd can be configured by specifying
[AccountingStorageBackupHost](slurm.conf.html#OPT_AccountingStorageBackupHost) in slurm.conf, as well as
[DbdBackupHost](slurmdbd.conf.html#OPT_DbdBackupHost) in
slurmdbd.conf. The backup host should be on a different machine than the one
hosting the primary instance of slurmdbd. Both instances of slurmdbd should
have access to the same database, share the same munge key(s), and have the
same users with the same UID/GIDs. The
[network page](network.html#failover) has a visual representation
of how this might look.

## Slurm JobComp Configuration

Presently job completion is not supported with the SlurmDBD, but can be
written directly to a database, script or flat file. If you are
running with the accounting storage plugin, use of the job completion plugin
is probably redundant. If you would like to configure this, some of the more
important parameters include:

* **JobCompHost**:
  Only needed if using a database. The name or address of the host where
  the database server executes.
* **JobCompLoc**:
  Only needed if using a flat file. Location of file to write the job
  completion data to.
* **JobCompPass**:
  Only needed if using a database. Password for the user connecting to
  the database. Since the password can not be securely maintained,
  storing the information directly in a database is not recommended.
* **JobCompPort**:
  Only needed if using a database. The network port that the database
  accepts communication on.
* **JobCompType**:
  Type of jobcomp plugin set to "jobcomp/mysql" or "jobcomp/filetxt".
* **JobCompUser**:
  Only needed if using a database. User name to connect to
  the database with.
* **JobCompParams**:
  Pass arbitrary text string to job completion plugin.

## Slurm Accounting Configuration Before Build

You can configure SlurmDBD to communicate with a database by using
**AccountingStorageType=accounting\_storage/slurmdbd**. This allows
the creation of user entities called "associations", which consist of the
cluster, a user, account and optionally a partition.

**MySQL or MariaDB is the preferred database.** Refer to the
[Upgrade Guide](upgrades.html#db_server) for information on in-place
upgrades of Slurm and DB server packages.

To enable this database support
one only needs to have the development package for the database they
wish to use on the system. **Slurm uses the InnoDB storage
engine in MySQL to make rollback possible. This must be available on your
MySQL installation or rollback will not work.**

The slurm configure
script uses mysql\_config to find out the information it needs
about installed libraries and headers. You can specify where your
mysql\_config script is with the
*--with-mysql\_conf=/path/to/mysql\_config* option when configuring your
slurm build.
On a successful configure, output is something like this:

```
checking for mysql_config... /usr/bin/mysql_config
MySQL test program built properly.
```

**NOTE**: Before running the slurmdbd for the first time there are several
MySQL/MariaDB server settings that should be reviewed.

* **innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size**:
  We recommend assigning between 5 and 50 percent of the available memory on the
  SQL server, and at least 4 GiB. Setting this value too small can cause problems
  when upgrading large Slurm databases or when purging old records.
* **innodb\_log\_file\_size**:
  This should be set to 25 percent of **innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size** divided by
  **innodb\_log\_files\_in\_group** to reduce unnecessary small writes to disk.
  Keep in mind that increasing this can cause recovery times when the SQL server
  shuts down unexpectedly.
* **innodb\_redo\_log\_capacity**:
  Use this instead of **innodb\_log\_file\_size** in MySQL 8.0.30+.
  This should be set to 25 percent of **innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size**.
* **innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout**:
  Set this to 900 seconds to allow some potentially extended queries to complete
  successfully.
* **max\_allowed\_packet**:
  We recommend at least 16M for this value, and is important to check when using
  older SQL server versions. If you are using
  **AccountingStoreFlags=job\_env,job\_script**, this must be greater than
  **max\_script\_size**.

See the following example:

```
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_buffer_pool_size';
+-------------------------+------------+
| Variable_name           | Value      |
+-------------------------+------------+
| innodb_buffer_pool_size | 4294967296 |
+-------------------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)


$cat my.cnf
...
[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size=4096M
innodb_log_file_size=1024M
innodb_lock_wait_timeout=900
max_allowed_packet=16M
...
```

Also, in MySQL versions prior to 5.7 the default row format was set to
*COMPACT* which could cause some issues during an upgrade when creating
tables. In more recent versions it was changed to *DYNAMIC*. The row
format of a table determines how its rows are physically stored in pages and
directly affects the performance of queries and DML operations. In very specific
situations using a format other than DYNAMIC can lead to rows not fitting into
pages and MySQL can throw an error during the creation of the table because of
that. Therefore it is recommended to read carefully about the row format before
creating your database tables if you are not using DYNAMIC by default, and
consider setting that if your database version supports it. If the
following InnoDB error shows up during an upgrade, the table can then be
altered (may take some time) to set the row format to DYNAMIC in order to
allow the conversion to proceed:

```
[Warning] InnoDB: Cannot add field ... in table ... because after adding it, the row size is Y which is greater than maximum allowed size (X) for a record on index leaf page.
```

You can see what the default row format is by showing the
*innodb\_default\_row\_format* variable:

```
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_default_row_format';
+---------------------------+---------+
| Variable_name             | Value   |
+---------------------------+---------+
| innodb_default_row_format | dynamic |
+---------------------------+---------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

You can also see how the tables are created by running the following command,
where *db\_name* is the name of your Slurm database (StorageLoc) set in
your slurmdbd.conf:

```
mysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS IN db_name;
```

Slurm assumes that the default collation for the database and table columns
is a case-insensitive one (also the default for MySQL databases). Using or
changing the collation to a case-sensitive one is not supported and will
cause slurmdbd to log an error message at start up if these are found.

You can check the default collation for the database this way (a *\_ci*
suffix indicates a case-insensitive collation):

```
mysql> SELECT default_collation_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name='db_name';
```

You can identify the database tables and columns that do not have a
case-insensitive collation this way:

```
mysql> SELECT table_name,column_name,collation_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='db_name' AND collation_name NOT LIKE '%_ci';
```

## Slurm Accounting Configuration After Build

For simplicity's sake, we are going to proceed under the assumption that you
are running with the SlurmDBD. You can communicate with a storage plugin
directly, but that offers minimal security.

Several Slurm configuration parameters must be set to support
archiving information in SlurmDBD. SlurmDBD has a separate configuration
file which is documented in a separate section.
Note that you can write accounting information to SlurmDBD
while job completion records are written to a text file or
not maintained at all.
If you don't set the configuration parameters that begin
with "AccountingStorage" then accounting information will not be
referenced or recorded.

* **AccountingStorageEnforce**:
  This option contains a comma separated list of options you may want to
  enforce. The valid options are any comma separated combination of
  + associations - This will prevent users from running jobs if
    their *association* is not in the database. This option will
    prevent users from accessing invalid accounts.
  + limits - This will enforce limits set on associations and qos'.
    By setting this option, the
    'associations' option is automatically set. If a qos is used the
    limits will be enforced, but 'qos' described below is still needed
    if you want to enforce access to the qos.
  + nojobs - This will make it so no job information is stored in
    accounting. By setting this 'nosteps' is also set.
  + nosteps - This will make it so no step information is stored in
    accounting. Both nojobs and nosteps could be helpful in an
    environment where you want to use limits but don't really care about
    utilization.
  + qos - This will require all jobs to specify (either overtly or by
    default) a valid qos (Quality of Service). QOS values are defined for
    each association in the database. By setting this option, the
    'associations' option is automatically set. If you want QOS limits to be
    enforced you need to use the 'limits' option.
  + safe - This will ensure a job will only be launched when using an
    association or qos that has a TRES-minutes limit set if the job will be
    able to run to completion. Without this option set, jobs will be
    launched as long as their usage hasn't reached the TRES-minutes limit
    which can lead to jobs being launched but then killed when the limit is
    reached.
    With the 'safe' option set, a job won't be killed due to limits,
    even if the limits are changed after a job was started and the
    association or qos violates the updated limits.
    By setting this option, both the 'associations' option and the
    'limits' option are set automatically.
  + wckeys - This will prevent users from running jobs under a wckey
    that they don't have access to. By using this option, the
    'associations' option is automatically set. The 'TrackWCKey' option is also
    set to true.**NOTE**: The association is a combination of cluster, account,
  user names and optional partition name.
    
  **Without AccountingStorageEnforce being set (the default behavior)
  jobs will be executed based upon policies configured in Slurm on each
  cluster.**
* **AccountingStorageExternalHost**:
  A comma separated list of external slurmdbds (<host/ip>[:port][,...]) to
  register with. If no port is given, the **AccountingStoragePort** will be
  used. This allows clusters registered with the external slurmdbd to communicate
  with each other using the *--cluster/-M* client command options.
  The cluster will add itself to the external slurmdbd if it doesn't exist.
  If a non-external cluster already exists on the external slurmdbd, the
  slurmctld will ignore registering to the external slurmdbd.
* **AccountingStorageHost**: The name or address of the host where
  SlurmDBD executes
* **AccountingStoragePass**: The password used to gain access to the
  database to store the accounting data. Only used for database type storage
  plugins, ignored otherwise. In the case of SlurmDBD (Database Daemon) with
  MUNGE authentication this can be configured to use a MUNGE daemon specifically
  configured to provide authentication between clusters while the default MUNGE
  daemon provides authentication within a cluster. In that case,
  **AccountingStoragePass** should specify the named port to be used for
  communications with the alternate MUNGE daemon
  (e.g. "/var/run/munge/global.socket.2"). The default value is NULL.
* **AccountingStoragePort**:
  The network port that SlurmDBD accepts communication on.
* **AccountingStorageType**:
  Set to "accounting\_storage/slurmdbd".
* **ClusterName**:
  Set to a unique name for each Slurm-managed cluster so that
  accounting records from each can be identified.
* **TrackWCKey**:
  Boolean. If you want to track wckeys (Workload Characterization Key)
  of users. A Wckey is an orthogonal way to do accounting against possibly
  unrelated accounts. When a job is run, use the --wckey option to specify a
  value and accounting records will be collected by this wckey.

## SlurmDBD Configuration

SlurmDBD requires its own configuration file called "slurmdbd.conf".
This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g. "slurm").
This file should be protected from unauthorized access since it
contains a database login name and password.
See [slurmdbd.conf](slurmdbd.conf.html)(5) for a more complete
description of the configuration parameters.
Some of the more important parameters include:

* **AuthInfo**:
  If using SlurmDBD with a second MUNGE daemon, store the pathname of
  the named socket used by MUNGE to provide enterprise-wide.
  Otherwise the default MUNGE daemon will be used.
* **AuthType**:
  Define the authentication method for communications between Slurm
  components. A value of "auth/munge" is recommended.
* **DbdHost**:
  The name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed.
  This should be a node name without the full domain name (e.g. "lx0001").
  This defaults to *localhost* but should be supplied to avoid a
  warning message.
* **DbdPort**:
  The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens
  to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD\_PORT as established at system
  build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
  This value must be equal to the *AccountingStoragePort* parameter in the
  slurm.conf file.
* **LogFile**:
  Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's
  logs are written.
  The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).
* **PluginDir**:
  Identifies the places in which to look for Slurm plugins.
  This is a colon-separated list of directories, like the PATH
  environment variable.
  The default value is the prefix given at configure time + "/lib/slurm".
* **SlurmUser**:
  The name of the user that the *slurmdbd* daemon executes as.
  This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon
  and have the same UID as the hosts on which *slurmctld* execute.
  For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.
  The default value is "root". This name should also be the same SlurmUser
  on all clusters reporting to the SlurmDBD.
  **NOTE**: If this user is different from the one set for **slurmctld**
  and is not root, it must be added to accounting with AdminLevel=Admin and
  **slurmctld** must be restarted.
* **StorageHost**:
  Define the name of the host the database is running where we are going
  to store the data.
  This can be the host on which slurmdbd executes, but for larger systems, we
  recommend keeping the database on a separate machine.
* **StorageLoc**:
  Specifies the name of the database where accounting
  records are written. For databases the default database is
  slurm\_acct\_db. Note the name can not have a '/' in it or the
  default will be used.
* **StoragePass**:
  Define the password used to gain access to the database to store
  the job accounting data.
* **StoragePort**:
  Define the port on which the database is listening.
* **StorageType**:
  Define the accounting storage mechanism.
  The only acceptable value at present is "accounting\_storage/mysql".
  The value "accounting\_storage/mysql" indicates that accounting records
  should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the
  *StorageLoc* parameter.
  This value must be specified.
* **StorageUser**:
  Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database
  with to store the job accounting data.

## MySQL Configuration

While Slurm will create the database tables automatically you will need to
make sure the StorageUser is given permissions in the MySQL or MariaDB database
to do so.
As the *mysql* user grant privileges to that user using a
command such as:

GRANT ALL ON StorageLoc.\* TO 'StorageUser'@'StorageHost';  
(The ticks are needed)

(You need to be root to do this. Also in the info for password
usage there is a line that starts with '->'. This a continuation
prompt since the previous mysql statement did not end with a ';'. It
assumes that you wish to input more info.)

If you want Slurm to create the database itself, and any future databases,
you can change your grant line to be \*.\* instead of StorageLoc.\*

Live example:

```
mysql@snowflake:~$ mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 538
Server version: 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.1 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create user 'slurm'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

You may also need to do the same with the system name in order
for mysql to work correctly:

```
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'system0';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
where 'system0' is the localhost or database storage host.
```

or with a password...

```
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'localhost'
    -> identified by 'some_pass' with grant option;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

The same is true in the case, you made to do the same with the
system name:

```
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'system0'
    -> identified by 'some_pass' with grant option;
where 'system0' is the localhost or database storage host.
```

Verify you have InnoDB support

```
mysql> SHOW ENGINES;
+--------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| Engine             | Support | Comment                                                        | Transactions | XA   | Savepoints |
+--------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| ...                |         |                                                                |              |      |            |
| InnoDB             | DEFAULT | Supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys     | YES          | YES  | YES        |
| ...                |         |                                                                |              |      |            |
+--------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
```

Then create the database:

```
mysql> create database slurm_acct_db;
```

This will grant user 'slurm' access to do what it needs to do on the local
host or the storage host system. This must be done before the SlurmDBD will
work properly. After you grant permission to the user 'slurm' in mysql then
you can start SlurmDBD and the other Slurm daemons. You start SlurmDBD by
typing its pathname '/usr/sbin/slurmdbd' or '/etc/init.d/slurmdbd start'. You
can verify that SlurmDBD is running by typing 'ps aux | grep
slurmdbd'.

If the SlurmDBD is not running you can
use the -v option when you start SlurmDBD to get more detailed
information. Starting the SlurmDBD in daemon mode with the '-D' option can
also help in debugging so you don't have to go to the log to find the
problem.

## SlurmDBD Archive and Purge

As time goes on, the slurm database can grow large enough that it is hard to
manage. To maintain the database at a reasonable size, slurmdbd supports
archiving and purging data based on its age. Purged data will be deleted from
the database, but you can choose to archive the data as it is being purged.
Archived data will be placed in flat files that can later be loaded into a
slurmdbd by sacctmgr.

It is strongly recommended to **make a plan** for data retention shortly
after setting up accounting. If purging is added after the database has already
grown to an unwieldy size, it may difficult to catch up to the desired purge
interval. Monitor table sizes and system utilization to decide how long you want
to retain data, and try to set the relevant configuration options before you
reach that time.

Archive and Purge options come in the form of **Archive${\*}** and
**Purge${\*}After**. See [slurmdbd.conf](slurmdbd.conf.html)(5)
for more details on the available configuration parameters.

The units for the purge options are important. For example:
*PurgeJobsAfter=12months* will purge jobs more than 12 months old at the
beginning of each month, while *PurgeJobsAfter=365days* will purge jobs
older than 365 days old at the beginning of each day. This distinction can be
useful for very active clusters, reducing the amount of data that needs to be
purged at one time.

### Archive Server

If ongoing access to Archived/Purged data is required at your site, it is
possible to create an archive instance of slurmdbd. Data previously archived
and purged from the production database can be loaded into the archive server,
keeping the production database at a manageable size while making sure old
records are still accessible.

The archive instance of slurmdbd should not be able to communicate with the
production server. Ideally they would have separate instances of MySQL/MariaDB
that they use to store their data. The Slurm controller (slurmctld) should
never communicate with the archive slurmdbd.

When configuring an archive server, there are certain database entries
that need to match the production server in order for the archived information
to show up correctly. In order to make sure the unique identifiers match,
mysqldump should be used to export the Association, QOS and TRES information.
The command to export these tables should look like this, with the appropriate
values substituted for <slurm\_user>, <db\_name>, and
<cluster>:

```
mysqldump -u <slurm_user> -p <db_name> <cluster>_assoc_table qos_table tres_table > slurm.sql
```

While mysqldump should be used to transfer the information from these tables,
it should not be used to transfer information that will be generated with the
Archive/Purge process. If mysqldump is used to try to get the desired
information, there will likely be a slight difference and when trying to load
archive files later there will either be a gap in records or duplicate
records that prevent the archive file from loading correctly.

## Tools

Slurm includes a few tools to let you work with accounting data;
**sacct**, **sacctmgr**, and **sreport**.
These tools all get or set data through the SlurmDBD daemon.

* **sacct** is used to retrieve details, stored in the database, about
  running and completed jobs.
* **sacctmgr** is used to manage entities in the database. These include
  clusters, accounts, user associations, QOSs, etc.
* **sreport** is used to generate various reports on usage collected over a
  given time period.

See the man pages for each command for more information.

While sreport provides the ability to quickly generate reports with some
of the most commonly requested information, sites frequently want additional
control over how the information is displayed. There are some third-party tools
that can assist in generating dashboards with graphs of relevant information
about your cluster. These are not maintained or supported by SchedMD, but these
utilities have been useful for some sites:

* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4323-slurm-dashboard/): Allows creation of dashboards with various graphs using data
  collected by Prometheus or InfluxDB.
* [InfluxDB](https://github.com/kcl-nmssys/slurm-influxdb):
  Includes an exporter tool that collects performance metrics from Slurm.
* [Prometheus](https://github.com/vpenso/prometheus-slurm-exporter): Includes an exporter tool that collects performance metrics from
  Slurm.

## Database Configuration

Accounting records are maintained based upon what we refer
to as an *Association*,
which consists of four elements: cluster, account, user names and
an optional partition name. Use the *sacctmgr*
command to create and manage these records.

**NOTE**: There is an order to set up accounting associations.
You must define clusters before you add accounts and you must add accounts
before you can add users.

For example, to add a cluster named "snowflake" to the database
execute this line
(**NOTE**: as of 20.02, slurmctld will add the cluster to the database upon
start if it doesn't exist. Associations still need to be created after
addition):

```
sacctmgr add cluster snowflake
```

Add accounts "none" and "test" to cluster "snowflake" with an execute
line of this sort:

```
sacctmgr add account none,test Cluster=snowflake \
  Description="none" Organization="none"
```

If you have more clusters you want to add these accounts, to you
can either not specify a cluster, which will add the accounts to all
clusters in the system, or comma separate the cluster names you want
to add to in the cluster option.
Note that multiple accounts can be added at the same time
by comma separating the names.
A *description* of the account and the *organization* to which
it belongs must be specified.
These terms can be used later to generate accounting reports.
Accounts may be arranged in a hierarchical fashion. For example, accounts
*chemistry* and *physics* may be children of the account *science*.
The hierarchy may have an arbitrary depth.
Just specify the *parent=''* option in the add account line to construct
the hierarchy.
For the example above execute

```
sacctmgr add account science \
 Description="science accounts" Organization=science
sacctmgr add account chemistry,physics parent=science \
 Description="physical sciences" Organization=science
```

Add users to accounts using similar syntax.
For example, to permit user *da* to execute jobs on all clusters
with a default account of *test* execute:

```
sacctmgr add user brian Account=physics
sacctmgr add user da DefaultAccount=test
```

If **AccountingStorageEnforce=associations** is configured in
the slurm.conf of the cluster *snowflake* then user *da* would be
allowed to run in account *test* and any other accounts added
in the future.
Any attempt to use other accounts will result in the job being
aborted.
Account *test* will be the default if he doesn't specify one in
the job submission command.

Associations can also be created that are tied to specific partitions.
When using the "add user" command of **sacctmgr** you can include the
*Partition=<PartitionName>* option to create an association that
is unique to other associations with the same Account and User.

## Cluster Options

When either adding or modifying a cluster, these are the options
available with sacctmgr:

* **Name=** Cluster name

## Account Options

When either adding or modifying an account, the following sacctmgr
options are available:

* **Cluster=** Only add this account to these clusters.
  The account is added to all defined clusters by default.
* **Description=** Description of the account. (Default is
  account name)
* **Name=** Name of account. Note the name must be unique and can not
  represent different accounts at different points in the account
  hierarchy
* **Organization=**Organization of the account. (Default is
  parent account unless parent account is root then organization is
  set to the account name.)
* **Parent=** Make this account a child of this other account
  (already added).

## User Options

When either adding or modifying a user, the following sacctmgr
options are available:

* **Account=** Account(s) to add user to
* **AdminLevel=** This field is used to allow a user to add accounting
  privileges to this user. Valid options are
  + None
  + Operator: can add, modify, and remove any database object (user,
    account, etc), and add other operators
      
    On a SlurmDBD served slurmctld these users can  
    - View information that is blocked to regular uses by a PrivateData
      flag
    - Create/Alter/Delete Reservations
  + Admin: These users have the same level of privileges as an
    operator in the database. They can also alter anything on a served
    slurmctld as if they were the slurm user or root.* **Cluster=** Only add to accounts on these clusters (default is all clusters)
  * **DefaultAccount=** Default account for the user, used when no account
    is specified when a job is submitted. (Required on creation)
  * **DefaultWCKey=** Default wckey for the user, used when no wckey
    is specified when a job is submitted. (Only used when tracking wckeys.)
  * **Name=** User name
  * **NewName=** Use to rename a user in the accounting database
  * **Partition=** Name of Slurm partition this association applies to

## Limit Enforcement

Various limits and limit enforcement are described in
the [Resource Limits](resource_limits.html) web page.

To enable any limit enforcement you must at least have
**AccountingStorageEnforce=limits** in your slurm.conf.
Otherwise, even if you have limits set, they will not be enforced.
Other options for AccountingStorageEnforce and the explanation for
each are found on the [Resource
Limits](resource_limits.html) document.

## Modifying Entities

When modifying entities, you can specify many different options in
SQL-like fashion, using key words like *where* and *set*.
A typical execute line has the following form:

```
sacctmgr modify <entity> set <options> where <options>
```

For example:

```
sacctmgr modify user set default=none where default=test
```

will change all users with a default account of "test" to account "none".
Once an entity has been added, modified or removed, the change is
sent to the appropriate Slurm daemons and will be available for use
instantly.

## Removing Entities

Removing entities using an execute line similar to the modify example above,
but without the set options.
For example, remove all users with a default account "test" using the following
execute line:

```
sacctmgr remove user where default=test
```

will remove all user records where the default account is "test".

```
sacctmgr remove user brian where account=physics
```

will remove user "brian" from account "physics". If user "brian" has
access to other accounts, those user records will remain.

Note: In most cases, removed entities are preserved in the slurm database,
but flagged as deleted.
If an entity has existed for less than 1 day, the entity will be removed
completely. This is meant to clean up after typographical errors.
Removing user associations or accounts, however, will cause slurmctld to lose
track of usage data for that user/account.

## Accounting Interpretation

Slurm accounting is mainly focused on parallel computing. For this reason it
gathers statistics at a "task level". A task is a set of user processes which
run in a step, which is part of a job. A user can submit a step with many
parallel tasks, e.g. by calling `srun -n`.

The [JobAcctGather](slurm.conf.html#OPT_JobAcctGatherType) plugin
gathers metrics for some [Trackable Resources (TRES)](tres.html),
like cpu, memory, energy, etc., at a given interval in the [JobAcctGatherFrequency](slurm.conf.html#OPT_JobAcctGatherFrequency)
defined in slurm.conf, or by using the `--acct-freq` option in the
command line. A poll of data is also triggered at the start or the end of a
step.

Depending on the nature of the metric, the values will be recorded as
standalone values or aggregated/calculated into a data structure.

For example, the **TresUsageInTot** field can be queried with
[sstat](sstat.html) during job runtime, and for every TRES, it
stores the sum of the gathered metrics of all tasks. For example, if we have 5
tasks, all of them consuming 1GB of memory, then the **TresUsageInTot**
would read "memory=5G". With the same example, and for the
**TresUsageInMax** instead, it will store the maximum memory peak seen by
any task of this step, so it would read "memory=1G".
If we then query **TresUsageInMaxNode** and **TresUsageInMaxTask**, we
will be able to see which task id had the largest memory peak and in which node
this event occurred. These values can be queried in the dedicated fields
**MaxRSS**, **MaxRSSNode** and **MaxRSSTask**.

Other considerations to be taken into account are that in some cases, like for
energy, the consumption is calculated by node. We don't have a value specific to
the task so if there are other jobs in the system, or many tasks, the
consumption at the time of running will be affected by all the processes in the
node.

After the job is done, the data will be stored in the database, and can be
queried with other tools, like [sacct](sacct.html). In that case the
**TresUsage\*** fields could have different meanings. For example in the case
of memory, **TresUsageInTot** will now store the sum of all peaks of memory
of all tasks of the step seen at any time. This value is not useful per-se, but
it is used to calculate **TresUsageInAve** to get the average memory peaks,
that can then be compared with **TresUsageInMax** (or **MaxRSS**) to see
if there was at least one outlier task in the step which consumed too much
memory, indication of some issue.

Note that for single task processes, **TresUsageInTot** could be used as the
maximum memory that the step consumed at any time, which will be equal to
**MaxRSS** and effectively represent the step memory peak.
Profiling works similarly, and we provide
[plugins](slurm.conf.html#OPT_AcctGatherProfileType) like HDF5
and InfluxDB that can help to visualize accounting data in other ways.
